		<h1 class="uppercase expand">What's DCON?</h1>
		<p>District Convention, or DCON, is an annual gathering of hundreds of Key Clubbers&mdash;from all over the state of New Jersey&mdash;to celebrate the end of a successful service year and the beginning of a new one. In 2016, the secret agent-themed DCON will take place at the <b>Ocean Place Resort</b> in <b>Long Branch, NJ,</b> from <b>Friday, April 1st to Sunday, April 3rd.</b></p>

		<p>Throughout the weekend, agents of service will enter contests, attend workshops, receive recognition for their accomplishments, participate in onsite service projects, and elect the next district executive board. There will also be dances held on Friday and Saturday nights&mdash;and the beach is right next door!</p>

		<p>Check out the official DCON 2016 Trailer below.</p>
