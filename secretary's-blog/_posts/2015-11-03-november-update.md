Salutations, New Jersey District Secretaries!

The next few months will be busy ones for the New Jersey District! Here are some things the New Jersey District Board would look you all to keep in mind: 

- 100% CMRF Award: To be eligible for the 100% CMRF Award, you must submit ALL CMRFs by November 10th, including the October CMRF. You are allowed to submit any missed CMRFs by this date as well. Feel free to contact your Lieutenant Governor or myself with any questions about this award. 
- Check out the Fall Rally board meeting summary! 
- Begin compiling a folder (if you have not already done so,) of all CMRFs, whether electronically or physically. A copy of a fillable Annual Achievement Report Form (AARF) will be included in the December Mailing; if all your CMRFs are in one place, it will be much easier to fill out the AARF and to get it done early! 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
Farwa Shakeel
