Salutations, New Jersey District Key Club secretaries! 

Believe it or not, we are near the end of the service year. But even with just a few weeks left in the service year, your club may be busier than ever- between keeping track of DCON Contests, to the AARF, to last minute service projects, this time of year may just be the most hectic! Here are some tips and tricks to helping your club run these last few weeks of the service year smoothly. 

- Fill out the Annual Achievement Report Form (AARF) by March 7th. That is the postmark date. My suggestion? Print out hard copies of all your CMRFs and have them in front of you while filling out the AARF. If you’ve ever taken handwritten notes at executive meetings, (or even electronic ones,) you may want to have those out as well just to make sure you don’t miss anything while filling out the AARF. You want to work closely with your club president and advisor in filling out the AARF. 
- Keep a spreadsheet of the members of your club attending DCON. The spreadsheet can have separate columns for each component of DCON registration. If a member misses anything, you can easily inform your advisor. Registration must be postmarked by March 3rd. 
- Keep a spreadsheet of entering any DCON contests and when they are postmarked. 
- Continue filling out CMRFs. If your club has elections before DCON, show your new secretary (or secretaries) how to fill out the CMRF and give them tips on how to stay organized. Your elected secretary should submit the March CMRF, if they are elected before DCON. 

As always, feel free to contact myself or your respective Lieutenant Governor with any questions or concerns. 

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
