Salutations, New Jersey District Key Clubbers! 

While summer may be coming to a close, the new school year also means a new Key Club service year! Over the summer, I have been working to make some changes that will further help out District. Here are some updates:

- This blog post will not be the only one- I plan to issue a blog post every month from now on, particularly for reference for club secretaries!
- I have edited the CMRF and created new CMRF instructions, as well as a new email specifically for CMRFs: njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com 

For Club Secretaries, here are some things to keep in mind as September continues:
- Create a template for your Minutes. There will be one included in this post and on the website, and you should receive it from your Lieutenant Governors shortly. 
- Use the CMRF to help guide your minute-taking! That way, it becomes much easier to fill out your CMRF and AARF (Annual Achievement Report Form) at the end of the year. 
- Itâ€™s not too late to hand in CMRFs! If you missed any CMRFs over the summer, you can still hand them in, and still be qualified for the 100% CMRF Award given at DCON. 
- Create an electronic folder with any pertinent files and share it with the rest of your club officers. This way, everything is easily accessible. This folder can include meeting minutes, agendas, registration forms, etc. 

I wish you all great success in this upcoming service year. Please feel free to contact me with any questions!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
Farwa Shakeel<br>
