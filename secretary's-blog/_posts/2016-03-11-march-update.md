Salutations, New Jersey District Secretaries!

It is with reluctance that I write to all of you this final blog post. I have enjoyed serving all of you as District Secretary for these past six months. I hope I have served you all well. 

The service year is ending, and that means it is time for club elections. To help ease the transition process from one officer board to the next, here are some guidelines: 

- Create Google Folders that are easily shareable with any important information. 
- Sit down with your new secretary and fill out a CMRF with him/her, so they know the jist of it! 
- Have your new secretary take minutes for the remaining meetings this year, so they can get accustomed to it! 

I hope to see many of you at this yearâ€™s District Convention!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
