Salutations, New Jersey District!

The holidays are upon us! On behalf of the New Jersey District Board, we wish you all a happy, healthy holiday season, full of service and success. 

As you enjoy celebrate this time with friends and family, please remember all those that will be in need of food this holiday season. Thereâ€™s still time before winter to set up some last minute fundraisers, like bake sales, movie nights, and others, to benefit the New Jersey Federation of Food Banks, to feed those who are in most need. Use the time over the break to come up with fun, innovative ways to benefit the Federation!

After break, we will have only 4 months remaining in the service year. With that being said, secretaries have a great deal of responsibility in the next few months. Here they are: 

- First, to fill out the Annual Achievement Report Form, or AARF. You should have received an electronic copy of the December District Mailing from the Lieutenant Governor. The Mailing consists of the AARF as well as other informational materials concerning District Convention. The AARF is a culmination of all your CMRFs (and therefore your accomplishments) for the service year. You MUST fill out the AARF to qualify for any District or International recognition. 
- Work with your club presidents and vice presidents to create a strategic plan on advertising and fundraising for DCON. 
- Assist your club presidents and advisors in filing for DCON contests. Some are pre-judged, while others are judged at DCON. Help keep your club organized by keeping close track of dates and deadlines for these contests, as well as DCON registration.  
- Apply for scholarships! New Jersey District of Key Club scholarships are available to all Key Clubbers. 

As always, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions. 

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
