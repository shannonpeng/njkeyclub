Hello New Jersey District of Key Club International,

My name is Mishell Sanchez, and I am truly honored to announce that I have been given the privilege to serve as the 2016-2017 Lieutenant Governor (LTG) for Division 1. I am already looking forward to all of the great things we will accomplish together. Currently, I am a junior at Lower Cape May Regional High School, and have been an active Key Club member since my freshman year. The experiences that I have had with this organization are truly inspiring. This club is one that never fails to make me feel like I have made an impact in this world, as it revolves around service and caring for others. This selfless organization has given me the skills of confidence and responsibility to take on the position of LTG to the best of my abilities.

Aside from Key Club, I am involved in several other activities within my school. For example, I am a member of Future Business Leaders of America, student council, Medical Explorers, and National Honor Society. I am also a part of our schoolâ€™s Spring Track Team and Winter Swimming Team. Outside of school, I continue to volunteer through my church. Although I am an active member of my school, Key Club has shown me how to handle the responsibilities that come with each activity. Throughout my high school career, one neat thing I have learned about myself is that I am not a morning person, but I find myself being wide awake at night, so I guess this is now not a bad thing because it can give me a lot of time to manage my Key Club responsibilities as well as balance my school commitments.

I am extremely proud to be part of the largest student-led service organization in the world, and with that, during my term of LTG for Division 1, I have a few goals to continue the success of Key Club.

* Meet and train 100% of Division 1 officers by the end of Summer

* Maintain strong communication between clubs

* Hold at least 2 divisional projects and 1 interdivisional event

* Establish a Builders Club at a nearby elementary school

* Improve attendance and participation in service events as well as meetings

* Have all dues paid early or on time

As my role of LTG, I am here to facilitate communication between the district board and the clubs within Division 1, so please if you have any questions for me feel free to contact me at any time. I look forward to witnessing the positive impact that this Division can make on our homes, schools and communities this service year.

Yours in caring and service,

Mishell Sanchez

Lieutenant Governor of Division 1
