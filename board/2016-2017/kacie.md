Hello Division 3!

It is with great honor that I introduce myself as your Lieutenant Governor for the 2016-2017 Service Year! My name is Kacie Reynolds and currently, I am a junior at Millville Senior High School.

Throughout my time as your Lieutenant Governor, I am going to strengthen our division to the best of my abilities. At first, I was a general member brought to a club by my best friend. At the time, I didn’t understand the impact that Key Club could have on the world around us. As, I found myself loving Key Club more and more, I knew that I wanted to be more involved. The next service year, I was my club’s president! I fell head over heels in love with serving my home, schools, and community. Service was something that I was always very passionate about, but being able to open my eyes and see what Key Club was doing on much larger scale, helped me enjoy it even more. During my first Fall Rally was when I really figured out that Key Club was too amazing for words. I hope that throughout this service year, you will find yourself falling in love with service and with Key Club just like I did. Key Club has given me the opportunity to break out of my shell and face my fears. I used to be very introverted, but I learned that I have a voice, that in fact, needs to be heard. Today, I would not be where I am today without Key Club, my home club advisor, and the people that I have met on this crazy journey so far.

Aside from serving with Key Club, I am very involved with my schoolwork. I don’t find myself involved with very many extracurriculars because, in simple terms, Key Club is my life. Besides Key Club, I am on my school’s Mock Trial team, in Gifted and Talented (GT), Leader’s Club, and my school’s World Language Honor Society for French. Even though I do not participate in many extracurriculars, I completely devote myself to the ones that I do participate in. Also, I have volunteered with my local PBA (Police Benevolent Association) since I was around seven years old. Every year, I help out with a dinner that they do for the homeless and elderly around Thanksgiving. I also help with different sporting events that they put on throughout the year.

Seeing how far I have come in three years is mind blowing. I have gained such a large amount from Key Club. I have made friends that will last a lifetime, gained impeccable public speaking skills, matured indefinitely, and found that no matter how small a club can be, we all can make a difference if we just put our minds to it.

I am so grateful to be serving as your Lieutenant Governor for this service year. With that, here are some of my goals for the service year:
1.) Have all officers trained by the beginning of summer vacation
2.) Maintain strong communication with my clubs

3.) Encourage interclub projects
4.) Host at least 3 divisional events, one of which, with another Division
5.) Go to 2 or more meetings or service projects per club
6.) Increase our Division’s attendance at District events such as Fall Rally and District Convention (DCON)
7.) Have all of my clubs submit dues by November 1, or at the latest, December 1
8.) Hold at least 10 District Council Meetings, where most of them meet quorum
9.) Work to try to charter a Kiwanis Family Club in our Division

As you can all tell, I am very honored to be serving as your Lieutenant Governor this service year. I am beyond excited to see what our Division can do! I look forward to coming to clubs and meeting you all personally! If you have any questions, concerns, or you just want to talk to me, I am always free to email, text, or call you! My email and cellphone number are at the top of this page. I usually answer the quickest by email or text though. I really look forward to spending this service year with you all. Look for more emails coming soon! Thank you!

Yours in Caring and Service,

Kacie Reynolds
Lieutenant Governor of Division 3
