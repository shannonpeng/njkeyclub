Salutations, Kiwanis Family!

It is my honor and pleasure to introduce myself as your 2015-2016 New Jersey District Secretary! I have been in
Key Club since my freshman year and have served as Club President of Piscataway High School Key Club and Lieutenant
Governor of Division 11 in the past. At the end of District Convention 2015, I was humbled to receive the Robert F.
Lucas Distinguished Lieutenant Governor Award, one of the highest honors I have ever received. I am so excited to
bring my enthusiasm and love for Key Club at the District level and serve all of you as best as I can.

I have dreamed of being an executive officer for the district board since I attended my first District Convention in
2013. It was then that I realized how Key Club is much more than just another volunteer organization; I knew that I was
part of something much bigger than myself and am still in awe of how much Key Clubbers are able to accomplish. With
that being said, I would like to assist all Key Clubs accomplish great things and achieve their fullest potential.
Some of my goals for this service year include:

- Making communication between clubs and the District Board as easy as possible, including making my
contact information available to all clubs and Lieutenant Governors.
- Working with the District Webmaster to ensure that all district resources are easily accessible on the
website
- Ensure that as many clubs as possible are sending Club Monthly Report Forms to their respective
Lieutenant Governors
- Working with the District Board to organize and execute a district-wide project
- Making this service as enjoyable as possible!

I look forward to a service year full of great service and success! Please do not hesitate to contact me for any
questions!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
Farwa Shakeel
