Dear Kiwanis Family, 

My name is Hanson Ky, and it is a pleasure and an honor to serve as the 2016-2017 Lieutenant Governor for Division 2. I am extremely grateful to have the opportunity to help this Division expand and triumph over the next year! Currently, I am a junior at the Egg Harbor Township High School, and I have been in Key Club serving my community and my school for three years. I was the Corresponding Secretary for my home club which gave me insight into the District and the club before becoming a Lieutenant Governor. Key Club has introduced me to many different opportunities, and the experiences I faced helped me conquer my fears while exposing new interests to me. It is safe to say that I would not have been the same person I am today without this club. 

Besides Key Club, I am involved in many different activities within my school. For example, I am a Committee Chair Member for Future Business Leaders of America, a member of Class Council, Medical Explorers, Chemistry League, and National Honor Society. Although I partake in other activities, the impact that Key Club has made on me leaves me astounded because I never would have guessed that my life would mature so quickly. Looking back into my freshmen year makes me reminiscence about how naïve and childish I was, but I am glad that my life took a turn for the better. Key Club has provided me with a diversity of service projects and leadership opportunities, and it is amazing to see how far I have come.  I had enduring yearnings such as making lifelong friends, traveling away from home, and giving back to my community, and Key Club gave me this advantage to fulfill these ambitions.

Again, I am so humbled to be able to serve as this year’s Lieutenant Governor for Division 2. I understand completely that this position requires my full-fledged dedication and devotion, and I will not be indolent, no matter the cost. Some of my major objectives that I hope to accomplish include:

* Training 100% of the officers
* Helping clubs create a strong foundation among each other
* Having at least two Divisional projects and an Interdivisional project
* Creating one Builder’s Club in one of the elementary schools nearby
* Making clubs expand with more members and service projects
* Becoming a Robert F. Lucas Lieutenant Governor

As Lieutenant Governor, I am here to assist Division 2 and the District in any way possible, so please reach out to me if you have questions or concerns. Thank you all so much as I cannot wait to work for this incredible club!

Yours in caring and in service,

Hanson Ky
