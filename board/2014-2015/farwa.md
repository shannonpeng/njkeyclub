My name is Farwa Shakeel and I am currently a sophomore at Piscataway Township High School! I am ecstatic to begin my term as Lieutenant Governor of Division 11 for the 2014 through 2015 service year!

This is my second year in Key Club, and it has been an incredible journey to this point. I was previously president of Piscataway High School Key Club and continued to also be an active member. Key Club has never failed to inspire me, to drive me to do more service each time I go to a service event. I have fallen in love with Key Club over and over again throughout my career as a Key Clubber, and I will never forget the smiles and service we have delivered over the course of my two years in Key Club. I know there will be many more to come.

I want to be the Lieutenant Governor that inspired me when I first began my journey in Key Club - motivating their members to continue service because the work we do truly has an immeasurable impact. I will work to:

- Create progress in clubs on both a technical and practical level, making sure Club Monthly Report Forms (CMRFâ€™s) are sent in on time.
- Make sure dues are paid on time, and preferably, Early Bird.
- Train all officers thoroughly and promptly
- Increase participation in divisional as well as district events, such as Fall Rally and DCON.
- Encourage clubs to host fundraisers, large or small
- Bring a vibrant sense of enthusiasm to the Key Clubs in my division, so that every member, in some way, leaves even the tiniest mark on the community or the world.

I am unspeakably excited to have a year full of smiles, service, and success!
