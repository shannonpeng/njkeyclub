Hello, New Jersey District, Key Club Officers, Advisers, and Kiwanis Committee. My name is Ricky Thompson and I have the honor the server as the Lieutenant Governor of Division 18 of the New Jersey District of Key Club International for the 2014 - 2015 service year. The new division 18 is formed of the clubs of Belleville High School, Bloomfield High School, Clifton High School, Glen Ridge High School, Montclair High School, Nutley High School and St. Mary’s High School. I am currently a sophomore at Bloomfield High School and started Key Club as a freshman. When I joined Key Club, I had prior skills with computers so I had decided to become the webmaster of my key club. I served as Webmaster for the 2012 - 2013 service year and Webmaster and Membership Director for the 2013-2014 service year. After attending Fall Rally, Key leader, DCON, RTCs and icon as a freshmen I saw a bigger perspective of Key Club, the district and international level of Key Club International. I decided to run a seconded time in February and was elected. My extracurricular activities include: Key Club, Key Club, and even more...you guessed it! Key Club.

My Goals for the 2014-2015 service year are:

- Train 100% of officers
- Have 2 or more divisional event to strengthen club to club communication
- Build 2 or more Key Clubs
- Build at least Builders club
- Build and maintain Divisional Website
- Attempt to have all clubs as Early Bird Due’s paid clubs
- Attend Every club’s meeting at least once every 2 months

Although I will serve as your Lieutenant Governor this year, do not be afraid to come and talk to me with whatever you need. I always have time on my hands and am never busy. If you need help at an event do not be afraid to ask me and I will be there to help.
