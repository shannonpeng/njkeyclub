My name is Priya Lad from Parsippany High School Key Club and it is with
great pleasure to introduce myself as the Lieutenant Governor of Division 20 for
the 2015-2016 service year.

As a freshman, I entered Key Club at a complete utter lost and confusion.
I was unsure of what the major emphasis of Key Club was and believed that we
actually made keys. Fooled by the name of the club, I was quite surprised when
I learnt a student run organization could have such an impact on my home, my
community and world. Through my two years of being a part of the club, I learnt
the meaning of giving back to your community and striving to do better.
Likewise, I was given the chance to serve my home club as Historian in the 2014-
2015 service year. Working side by side by my fellow officers, I was able to learn
the ins and outs of a successful club.

For those you are still unsure of who I am, I ensure you that I am a typical
high student who stresses on a daily basis to finish my homework and cram for
my exams. In my free time, you most likely will find me stuffing my face or
sleeping. I also watch an endless amount of TV shows, draw, and paint, run and
read books.

On a serious note, during the upcoming service year, there are some key
goals I would like to accomplish as a division. It is key for not only Division 20 to
work together, but it will help us make a bigger difference on a worldwide
spectrum.

Some goals that I would like to meet:

- Meet quorum for at least 2 out of 5 Divisional Council Meetings
- Get all the officers trained by the beginning of the school year
- Improve the communication and participation within the club
- Establish key goals for each club to meet
- Help each and every club reach their goal for the service year

It is my duty to transfer your message to the district board. I will not fail you
and be right by your side when taking the next step to reach your clubâ€™s goal for the service year. Please feel free to ask me any questions or tell me ideas for events which I could convey to all my other peers. I ensure you I will be the factor that will create a difference within our division, the New Jersey district and the world.
