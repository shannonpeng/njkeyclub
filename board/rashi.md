Hello New Jersey District!

My name is Rashi Bhatt and I am going to be serving as the new Lieutenant Governor of Division 6.

I come from North Brunswick Township High School which is Division 11, however, I know a good number of students who come from the schools in Division 6! I am currently a junior and I have been a part of Key Club since my freshman year.
