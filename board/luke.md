It is with great pleasure to announce that I, Luke McGeown, a current sophomore at BridgewaterRaritan
Regional High School, will be serving as your Lieutenant Governor for Division 12 during the
2015-2016 service year.

Although this is only my first year as a member of Key Club, I have already experienced much of what
this organization has to offer. The very nature of how I became a member speaks volumes about the
Key Club community. After speaking many of my close friends about what Key Club really was, often
beginning with facetious remarks about how they learned to cast metal keys, I came to understand not
only the virtuous goals of Key Club as a whole, but also the openness and kindness of the people who
serve. Attending the divisional and district Eliminathon as well as multiple fundraising events at my
home club showed me how special this organization truly is.

This may be my first year as a member of Key Club, but I am no stranger to the power of serving one’s
community. As a member of North Branch Reformed Church, I have dedicated countless hours over
the years to volunteering in many ways. I have also dedicated much of my time to volunteering in
many events within the Bridgewater-Raritan Regional School District, including tutoring students at
Milltown Elementary School. Key Club exemplifies how successful service programs can be, which
was already quite appealing to me by the time I considered joining.

Aside from Key Club, I am also a member of the Future Business Leaders of America, the Forensics
Speech and Debate team, and the Boys Junior Varsity Volleyball Team at BRHS. I am also currently
in the process of seeking acceptance into my school’s German Honors Society. Outside of school I
continue to volunteer through church and school in many ways.

This year you can expect many changes to occur in this division. With Key Club as my top priority, I
know I can bring a lot to improving the effectiveness of our district as a whole by:

- Chartering an Aktion Club and a Key Club
- Encouraging strong communications between the clubs of Division 12
- Having 100% dues paid by November 1st
- Having 100% officers trained by the end of summer vacation
- Hosting at least two divisional events
- Improve general member meeting attendance and activity

I guarantee that I will go above and beyond in all of my obligations and ensure that we can all work
together to serve our community. I am looking forward to helping make the 2015-2016 service year
the best it can possibly be.
