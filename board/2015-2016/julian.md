I am Julian Maceren, a junior at North Brunswick Township High School, and I am
beyond excited to start working as Lieutenant Governor of Division 11 for the 2015-
2016 service year. From a very young age, service has always been a part of my
life. I volunteered at soup kitchens, hospitals, and a summer school for kids with
autism. To me, service isn’t about the hours or the graduation requirement─it’s
about the difference I can make and world I can change. In high school, Key Club
became the outlet by which I could exhaust my passion for service, and since I
joined, I have been heavily involved. I participated in a myriad of Key Club events
and during my junior year, I became club Editor. My experiences with volunteering
and with Key Club have prepared me for this position, and I hope to maintain the
success that my predecessors have.

Aside from Key Club, I am very active in my high school. I play three sports: cross
country, swimming, and tennis, and although I’m no county champion or
outstanding athlete, I still have a lot of fun. In terms of academics, I am in National
Honors Society, Science League, Mathletes, and Chemistry Olympiad. I also
participate in the Waksman Institute of Microbiology program where I perform labs
and analyze DNA sequences with other students at my high school. In addition, I
am the co-head of the tutoring program at my high school and I created (and
currently maintain) a website to help encourage more students to join the program.
Other than school related activities, the rest of my day consists of eating, sleeping,
eating some more, and spending time with my family.

In order to maintain success in my division, I have set various goals for myself:

- Improve communication among the division
- Improve event participation
- Have 100% trained officers by November
- Hold at least one divisional event
- Frequent visits to all my clubs
- Have all dues paid on time or early
- Build 2 new clubs: a Builder’s Club at the middle school I attended, and a KKids
club at the Elementary school I attended.
- Maintain Division 11’s traditional divisional dinner
- Introduce new and exciting service projects

There are no words capable of capturing my excitement to start working with my
Division for the 2015-2016 service year. I will work tirelessly, meticulously, and
passionately to ensure Division 11’s success. This service year will definitely be one
wild ride, and I can’t wait to journey through it with my Key Club family. If you
have any questions, concerns, or just need someone to talk to, you can contact me
at 908-227-5295, or email me at ltg11.maceren@gmail.com. I can’t wait to meet
all of you soon.
