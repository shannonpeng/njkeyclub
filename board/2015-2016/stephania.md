I would like to introduce myself as the Lieutenant Governor of Division 14 for the 2015-2016 service year. My name is Stephania Gonzalez and I am currently a junior at Elizabeth High School. I humbly thank and congratulate this division for all the work put forth by each of its clubs in servicing our schools and community. In the past, I have served as a general member, vice president and president of my home club before taking on this
role as Lieutenant Governor. This service year is going to be my fourth but hopefully not my last year as part of the K- Family.

My Key Club journey began my freshman year. At first I was simply looking to join any club in order to make new friends and make my high school experience into a memorable one. In the beginning, I was a bit overwhelmed with the size of my club, but after a few short meetings and events, I learned what key club was really about. When I’m asked what my defining moment in key club was, my answer is simple… I do not have one, I have dozens. Every single time that I attend events like DCON, Key Leader, Regional Training Conferences, Midwinter, etc. I fall in love with Key Club all over again.

Key Club has influenced my life in ways that I never thought possible. The club opened my eyes to the reality of the world around me, the troubles that face our community, and what we can do to help. My hope is that I can spread that same passion for service to those around me and to influence our members to remain active in club through the whole service year. Outside of Key Club I am involved in other clubs, organizations and committees; but there is not a single ounce of doubt in my mind where key club lies in my priorities; it lies in my heart. In my spare time, I enjoy reading, drawing/painting, and most important of all spending time with my
friends and family.

As Lieutenant Governor I have many responsibilities as well as goals set forth for this service year. These include the following:

- Increasing communication with the clubs in the division
- Forming a strong bond with all of the clubs, advisors, officers, and Kiwanis
- Holding several divisional and interdivisional events
- Having dues in every club paid in a timely fashion
- Training all club officers before Fall Rally 2015.
- Augmenting not just our division membership but our division’s presence at the district level. 
  - Encouraging clubs to increase their presence at events like Fall Rally, Key Leader, District
Convention (DCON), and International Convention (ICON).
- Increasing the number of K-Family Clubs in this division
- Strengthening the weaker clubs
- Lastly, but most important, serving our school and community, making memories, and having fun!

I’m incredibly excited for this service year and will strive to do and give all that I can to this marvelous division. I aspire to grow and strengthen our division as both a club and a family of dedicated servant leaders. Please feel free to contact me through Facebook, our divisional website, text message, or just giving me a phone call. I will be available to answer any questions, concerns, and take note of any ideas to improve this division. I’m
looking forward to meeting all of you very soon!
