Dear New Jersey District of Key Club International,

It is with great pride and enthusiasm, that I announce that I, Benjamin Rogovin, a sophomore at James Caldwell High School, will proudly serve as the Lieutenant Governor of Division 19 for the 2016-2017 service year.

Throughout my high school career thus far, Key Club has played an important role in my growth as a leader and to the service I have provided to my home, school and community. As a mere freshman, I had the pretext that Key Club was just a group of kids making keys. I would soon be proven wrong. I joined Key Club as an ambitious student, who cares deeply for the world around him. At that moment in my life, I was not aware that this organization would become such a major part of who I am today. After working hard and attending countless service projects as a freshman, I came to the conclusion that my level of service was ready to reach greater heights. I would then run for a leadership position on the board at my school. This was a big stepping stone and decision, one that I look back on with great content. After being elected the photographer on the board, I was a bit disappointed as I was not given the higher position I sought. Rather than being discouraged, I took what was given to me and ran with it. I made sure to be the best photographer I had the capacity to be, attending every event. As photographer, I was given the opportunity to see the impact that Key Club makes from a different perspective. To be literal, I was looking at the magic of Key Club through the lens of camera, but in contrast, I was figuratively watching all the immense service unfold in front of me. Because of this position, I now have a keen eye for the passion and dedication all Key Clubbers share. 

Although Key Club has been a main focus of my extracurricular life, there are many other activities which I enjoy participating in. At my high school, I am an avid participant in many club and activities, such as Class Council, Theater Arts Club, and Interact Club. Since the age of five, I have wholeheartedly performed in countless musicals, sharing my theatrical ability and love with others. Being on stage and taking on the role of a character unlike myself has been a challenge I have embraced. I also like to do as much service to the community outside of school as I can. For instance, in partnership with the Boys and Girls Club, I tutor students at Gregory Elementary School in West Orange. This gives me the opportunity to assist kids who may not have someone to help them. In addition, I have been a camp counselor for the past two summers and I am excited to work exclusively with special needs children during this upcoming summer. In addition to the numerous extracurricular activities I partake in, I am a consistently good student as I challenge myself with accelerated classes and flourish in all of my academic courses.

With the passion I have for Key Club and great ambition I have set a handful of objectives I hope to achieve while on the New Jersey District Board. These include:

Enhance communication within Division 19
Encourage partnership between clubs
Have all officers trained by October 2016
Have all dues paid before December 2016
Hold at least two divisional events
Improve the activity of members
Charter an Aktion Club

Although these expectations may seem far-fetched, I strongly believe that we, together, can accomplish these goals. I so look forward to meeting you all and having the opportunity to work hand in hand with such amazing people!

Yours in Caring and Service, 
 
Benjamin Rogovin
Lieutenant Governor of Division 19
