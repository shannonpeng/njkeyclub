Dear Division 10,

My name is Bobbie Boettinger and I am pleased to introduce myself as the 2016-2017 Lieutenant Governor of Division 10. Division 10 includes Holmdel, Keansburg, Keyport, Marlboro, St. John Vianney, Matawan Regional, and Raritan. I am currently a junior at West Essex High School. As a freshman, I was a general member when I began high school. From there I became the Lieutenant Governor of Division 19. This past service year of 2015-2016 I was your District Treasurer. I am extremely excited to be on the district board once again!

Not only am I a part of Key Club, but I also sing in my schoolâ€™s choir, and play volleyball. I always have loved music, and just like Key Club, my passion and love for it grows stronger as each day goes by. Anything that I am involved in, I put all of my passion, dedication, and hard work into it. I cannot wait to work with all of you as your Lieutenant Governor for our upcoming service year. I am a team player that loves to help anyone as much as I can. I am a very personable and approachable, so feel free to talk to me at any time throughout the year.

As LTG I have goals I want to accomplish for this upcoming year. Some of my goals are:

* Collect all CMRFs from clubs every month

* Build more communication between the clubs of Division 10

* Hold 2 Divisional Events

* Connect with the members of the clubs

I cannot wait for the new service year to begin. I am very excited to meet and work with you all. If you ever have any questions, concerns, or ideas feel free to call, text, or email me. You can also find me on social media and reach me through there!

Yours in Caring and Service,

Lieutenant Governor of Division 10 Bobbie Boettinger
