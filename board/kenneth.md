I am Kenny Pritchard, a junior at Bridgewater-Raritan High School, and it brings me immense pride to say that I will be serving as Lieutenant Governor of Division 12 for the 2016-2017 service year.

Before Key Club I had not been involved with any extracurricular activities at all, so my sophomore year saw my growth as an active member of my school in addition to my growth as a member of Key Club. In fact, Key Club also introduced me to my first experiences with serving the community. I enjoyed attending the mini service projects that my officers set up at each meeting and signing up for events at my elementary school, Adamsville. Returning to Adamsville as a high schooler was (and still is) a wonderful experience because I have the privilege of being a part of the group that makes events fun and enjoyable for the children that participate. It is very rewarding to return to the events I once went to as an elementary schooler to return the favor and reconnect with my old teachers.

Towards the end of my sophomore year, I decided that I wanted to become more involved with the behind-the-scenes of Key Club. I signed up to run for editor, but, due to a combination of anxiousness and fear of the responsibility, decided to back out on the day of the election (a very regrettable decision in retrospect). Despite this initial blunder, I came back early in this school year and ran for editor again when the position opened up. I was selected for the position this time around. It came with great relief that becoming more involved exceeded my expectations in the best way possible. I met and became more acquainted with the officers, who all turned out to truly care about serving the community. Almost as soon as I became an editor I decided to run for Lieutenant Governor with the encouragement of the current NJ Key Club Governor, Luke. This brings me to the current excitement of being your new LTG.

As I said before, Key Club was the beginning of my extracurricular involvements. I have now also been a part of several clubs including the Latin Honor Society, in which I am a Junior Consul, the Future Business Leaders of America, the Math Honor Society, the Math League, and the Cakes for a Cause Club, in which we held a bake sale each month to fundraise for different kinds of cancer research. Though I enjoy participating and am proud to be a member of each of these clubs, I consider my involvement with Key Club my highest priority and most significant responsibility.

As such, I aspire to accomplish several goals before my service year is over. Although a person cannot always accomplish all of their goals realistically, it is important to at least attempt them because progress is better than abandonment. Here are some of my goals:

* Perform all of my responsibilities in a timely manner
* Train 100% of officers, most or all before summer
* Visit clubs during their meetings
* Hold divisional events
* Collect CMRFs and dues
* Hold co-divisional events with the Lieutenant Governors of neighboring divisions
* Drastically increase Division 12’s attendance at DCON next year
* Charter new clubs, especially geared towards the younger kids (K-Kids, Builder’s Club) in order to create a stronger base for membership when those kids reach high school age
* Remain an open and communicative tool for all officers
* Earn the Robert F. Lucas Distinguished Lieutenant Governor award

If anyone ever has any questions or concerns at all, please contact me with the information at the top of the page. I am happy to help.

Yours in caring and service, 

Kenny Pritchard
