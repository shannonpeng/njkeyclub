International Convention has a reputation for being the largest Key Club event of the service year. This year is not any kind of exception to the reputation of International Convention, but has an expectation of being even more of a once in a lifetime event than ever. This summer the New Jersey District will be traveling to Indianapolis, Indiana to the Key Club International 72nd International Convention to celebrate the 100th service years of Kiwanis International. For this centennial celebration there will not only be the Key Club International Convention, but a joint International Convention with Key Club, Circle K, and Kiwanis. Indianapolis, Indiana is rated USA Today’s best convention city in the United States and we will be celebrating there with an expected 12,000 attendees. The 2015 International Convention being described as splendiferous would be an understatement.

2015 not only marks the centennial birthday of Kiwanis International, Key Club’s parent organization, but also an end to the ELIMINATE project campaign. At International Convention we will be celebrating the achievements of Key Club International for fundraising for the ELIMINATE project. As of 2015 Kiwanis International has raised $80 million towards ELIMINATE to help with efforts towards eradication maternal and neonatal tetanus and the disease has been eradicated in 16 countries as of April 2015. The accomplishments of the clubs of the New Jersey District over the past years with the ELIMINATE campaign will be recognized and are very much appreciated.

International Convention can be a beneficial opportunity for many reasons. The convention can be used as an opportunity to make business connections with service organizations represented at the convention and with other Key Clubbers in attendance. At International Convention the next International Board of Trustees will be elected for the 2015-2016 service year. At the House of Delegates, attendees from each school will be voting on amendment to the bylaws of Key Club International. In this way and many more, International Convention is a way to see the way Key Club’s International level works and help set the stage for the new service year. Not only business connections but friendships and memories to last a lifetime will be in store at the 2015 International Convention. All attendees are sure to have the experience of a lifetime at the 72nd Key Club International Convention!
