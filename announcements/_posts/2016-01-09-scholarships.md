Hello, New Jersey District Key Clubbers!

As hard as it may be to believe, the Key Club service year is quickly ending.

For many, this may be your last year and time to say goodbye. However, you have the great opportunity to be rewarded for your dedication to Key Club and your determination to make the world a better place!  Each year, the New Jersey District grants different scholarships each ranging from $1,000 - $2,000. This year there are 17 different scholarships.

All information regarding these scholarships can be found in the scholarships packet, but here is a brief list of what is required within your application:

* An essay detailing your favorite Key Club service project (Maximum: Two pages).

* Two letters of recommendation from adults who are familiar with your service, neither of which can be a relative.

* Advisor verification of your service, particularly if you must estimate your number of hours/points, in the case that your club does not record hours/points.

* Brief description of all your service, inside and outside of Key Club, and your greatest achievement outside of Key Club.

All scholarship applications must be postmarked by February 24th, 2016. Any application not postmarked by this date will not be considered.

The New Jersey District of Key Club Kiwanis Committee will be reading your applications to determine the winners. The recipients of the scholarships will be announced at District Convention 2016!

I greatly look forward to receiving your applications! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Yours in Caring and Service,

Ciara Leonor P. Clarkin
