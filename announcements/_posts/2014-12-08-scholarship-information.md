Salutations, New Jersey District Key Clubbers!

Although it may seem like the service year just began, it is quickly coming to a close!

For many of you, this year will be the last for your Key Club career. Fortunately, you have the opportunity to be rewarded for your dedication to Key Club! Each year, the New Jersey District grants 14 different scholarships, each ranging between $1,000-$2,000.

All information is located in the scholarship packet. You can ask your Lieutenant Governor for a packet, but here is a quick breakdown of what you need to include in your application:

- A two page essay detailing your favorite Key Club service project.
- Two letters of recommendation from adults who are familiar with your service, neither of which can be a relative.
- Advisor verification of your service, especially if you must approximate your number of hours/points, in the case that your club does not record hours/points
- Brief description of all your service, inside and outside of Key Club, and your greatest achievement outside of Key Club.

All scholarship applications must be postmarked by February 20th, 2015. Any application not postmarked by this date will not be considered.

Scholarship recipients will be announced at District Convention!

I look forward to reading about your favorite service projects! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact <a href="/board/farwa.html">me</a>.

Yours in Caring and Service,
Farwa Shakeel
