This year’s Spring Regional Training Conferences were a success. The hard work of the host clubs and the New Jersey District Board members who helped choreograph the events paid off as Key Clubbers from all over New Jersey successfully learned the ins and outs of everything Key Club. The Spring Regional Training Conferences were held in Roxbury for the Northern session on May 4, 2014, and in Cedar Creek (co-hosted by the Cedar Creek and Absegami Key Clubs) for the Southern session on May 10, 2014. Both ran from 9 am to 1 pm, with every minute full of learning and laughter. The RTC theme this service year is Greek/Roman mythology, as the New Jersey District is trying to climb Mount Service! The host clubs did a spectacular job in decorating their school to fit the theme. Their hard work with decorations helped provide Key Clubbers the ultimate experience at the conferences.

Along with theme-related decorations, Key Clubbers attended creative workshops, such as *Bringing in the Drachmas: Fundraising and Speaking like Roman Emperor: Public Speaking*. The workshops were all split up into three sessions, each one also named to correspond with the theme. The first session, Session Alpha, referred to the first letter of the Greek alphabet. Session Mu, the second session, was named after the twelfth and middle letter of the Greek alphabet. The last session, Session Omega, referred to the last letter of the Greek alphabet. A wide variety of workshops were given during each session, from workshops that taught club officers about their positions to ones that explained how general members can get involved to workshops that addressed the district projects for this service year.

Many people attended the spring conferences, and each person had their own great and unique experience. Kenneth Ye, President of Egg Harbor Township Key Club in Division 2, said, “The Spring RTC’s were invigorating and eye-opening with the variety of workshops and events for officers and fellow Key Club members! It was truly amazing experience that allowed me to gain further knowledge and skills to help me with my position in Key Club, and it was great to meet everyone around our area.”

After such a great spring session, the NJ District Board has high expectations for an even better fall session! The Fall Northern RTCs will be on September 20, 2014; Central RTCs will be on September 14, 2014; and Southern will be on September 13, 2014. While club officers are required to attend a Regional Training Conference in order to be distinguished, all Key Clubbers are encouraged to attend a Fall RTCeven if they already attended one in the spring! There will be exciting icebreakers, updated information, and new workshops like “You, Your Ltg., and Your Division” and “Get that Olympic Gold: Contests and DCON,” all of which promise a day of useful information and many smiles.
