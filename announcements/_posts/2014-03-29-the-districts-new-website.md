# The New Website

Hello everyone! This is your District Webmaster Srikar, and I am proud to announce that the new district website has been released!

# What's Different?

In terms of design, not much has changed since the last version of the website. I greatly appreciate the design skills of our former webmaster, Yuya Jeremy Ong. However, I have added several new features to the website that make it even easier to access and gain information from! The following is a list of those changes:

- The website is now mobile-friendly. What does this mean you ask? Well, now you can browse the district website on small screens without having to scroll around and zoom in and out. In short, the contents of the website fit to any screen that you may have. Try resizing your browser now!
- Each district board member now has their own blog! You can see the posts of a member by clicking on their name in the [board section of our website](/board/)! For example, click [here](/board/srikar.html) to see my posts!
- You can also find the contact information and introduction letter of a member on the same page as the blog posts!
- There is a new calendar page on the website which has a Google Calendar. This calendar will be updated with various district events, so it's a good idea to sync it with your phone and computer!
- You can now find Key Clubs near your location by visiting the [District Map Page](/resources/district-map)! Once the page loads, allow it to access your location and soon, you will see a map with markers indicating Key Clubs near your current area. Try zooming in and out of the map to find more Key Clubs!
- I added a new [Quotes Page](/quotes) which includes several inspirational quotes that the District Board and Key Clubbers have found! Have a new quote? Send it to my email ([njwebmastersrikar@gmail.com](mailto:njwebmastersrikar@gmail.com)) with the subject line *New Quote For District Website*!
- Key Clubbers can comment on blog posts now! Please note that comments are approved by the District Board before they are posted. This system is in place to prevent spam comments.
