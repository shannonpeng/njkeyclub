The American Cancer Society is an organization that works tirelessly to save lives and makes strides towards eradicating cancer. On May 23rd, 1913, 10 doctors and 5 laypeople in New York City founded the American Cancer Society (ACS), and it was initially called the American Society for the Control of Cancer (ASCC). Researchers funded by the ACS have contributed to nearly every major cancer research breakthrough that has been seen in almost 70 years since the start of ACS’s research program. They’ve helped establish the link between cancer and smoking; developed cancer-fighting drugs and biological response modifiers such as interferon; and much more.

As a Key Clubber, there are many ways to help the American Cancer Society achieve their goal. Donating is obviously crucial to the success of any organization, especially to one fighting cancer.  However, personal donations are not necessary; soliciting funds from community members is a very effective way of raising funds. The American Cancer Society is well known for many of their events, such as Relay for Life, Making Strides for Breast Cancer, DetermiNation, and Coaches vs. Cancer.  The most renowned of their events is Relay for Life, which is an organized, overnight community walk. Teams are formed and they raise funds while members of each team take turns walking around the track. Camaraderie is built throughout the night through food, games, and activities with a family-friendly environment. Relay for Life events are very successful events, and a huge amount of fun to all of those who participate. A Key Club could help organize and recruit participants for a Relay for Life event (or any other American Cancer Society event), making it a huge community event.
 
More than one million people in the United States get cancer each year. As Key Clubbers, we can do as much as we can with volunteering at the many ACS events and through fundraising for their events. It is also important to remember that even though your Key Club may not be able to host an event, or very few American Cancer Society opportunities may arise near you, advocating is essential to the success of any organization. The use of social media, and first hand encouragement of others to get involved, can go a long way!
