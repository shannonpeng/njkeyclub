Remember last summer when everyone was pouring buckets of ice cold water on their heads in support of ALS and each person nominated 3 other people to do the same challenge? You could either accept the challenge and also donate $10 (or more), or deny the challenge and donate $100. This summer, the Pacific Northwest District of Key Club has kick started a new challenge called the Elemonate Challenge to support the Eliminate Project. 

In order to take part in this challenge, you just need Â¼ of a lemon and a camera or phone with video capabilities. Once you start the video, say your name and who you were nominated by, and nominate 3 other people (or organizations). Then on the count of 3, bite into the lemon and chew it fully through. When completed, we ask that you donate at least $1.80 towards the Eliminate Project. $1.80 is enough for a series of 3 vaccinations to save a mother and all of her future babies from Maternal Neonatal Tetanus, or MNT. MNT takes the life of a newborn child every 11 minutes. 

On August 15th, the New Jersey District Board of Trustees participated in the Elemonate Challenge at their second board meeting of their terms. The New Jersey District Board of Trustees was nominated by Governor Josie Suddeth when she was at LeadCon and we decided to nominate all Key Clubbers in the entire New Jersey District. The Eliminate Project has been a large part of the K-Family in the past few years, especially in the New Jersey District of Key Club. 

We challenged you to accept the Elemonate Challenge so cut up a lemon, grab a few friends, video your challenge, nominate a few friends, and then donate! Enjoy that sour lemon!
