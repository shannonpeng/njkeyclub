   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you all are well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCON is rapidly approaching, no matter how much I hate to say it. DCON this year is going to be a truly remarkable event. DCON 2016 will be from April 1st-3rd at the Ocean Place Resort and Spa in Long Branch. DCON is the celebration of an outstanding year of service and the kickoff to an even greater one. This year’s theme is License to Serve (Mission Impossible/ James Bond). There are a lot of exciting plans we have to incorporate the theme. Use your club’s two votes in the district executive officer elections! Scream for the spirit stick! Have fun at dances! Be inspired by our keynote speaker! Make connections with other service oriented individuals! Attend interactive workshops! All information about DCON is on njkeyclub.org. Read more below about other unique aspects of our convention!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to sign up for this fantabulous event, you have to register. The regular registration deadline is March 12th. But wait! If your registration is postmarked by February 12th, it is $5 less per person. If cost is a concern, I recommend having fundraisers to offset the cost or talk to your Kiwanis Club!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another unique aspect of DCON is the opportunity to enter contests. I &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;highly&lt;/span&gt; encourage you all to enter contest!!! All contests winners are announced at DCON. The contests packet was sent to all clubs in the December Mailing. Some contests are due prior to convention so be sure to pay attention to the deadlines. Your club has done so much this year; why not fill out an application and inspire other clubs to change lives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The District Spike Out Hunger Tournament is also soon! It will be at Schor Middle School in Piscataway on February 21st. Registration will begin at 12:45 and the first match will start at 1:15. Come see the winners of the divisional tournaments battle it out! It will be a lot of fun!!! Admission is $5 or 3 pounds of food. All proceeds will benefit our District Project: The NJ Federation of Food Banks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, do not hesitate to contact me or your LTG with any questions, especially about DCON. I want to see as many of you there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;br&gt;

Walking since 1970, March of Dimes has raised an incredible $2.3 billion to benefit all babies. To participate in the walk you can either fundraise and walk or volunteer at the event. For more information on your local walk or about how to get involved contact your Lieutenant Governor.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, New Jersey District Key Clubbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As hard as it may be to believe, the Key Club service year is quickly ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many, this may be your last year and time to say goodbye. However, you have the great opportunity to be rewarded for your dedication to Key Club and your determination to make the world a better place!  Each year, the New Jersey District grants different scholarships each ranging from $1,000 - $2,000. This year there are 17 different scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All information regarding these scholarships can be found in the scholarships packet, but here is a brief list of what is required within your application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An essay detailing your favorite Key Club service project (Maximum: Two pages).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two letters of recommendation from adults who are familiar with your service, neither of which can be a relative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advisor verification of your service, particularly if you must estimate your number of hours/points, in the case that your club does not record hours/points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brief description of all your service, inside and outside of Key Club, and your greatest achievement outside of Key Club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All scholarship applications must be postmarked by February 24th, 2016. Any application not postmarked by this date will not be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey District of Key Club Kiwanis Committee will be reading your applications to determine the winners. The recipients of the scholarships will be announced at District Convention 2016!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I greatly look forward to receiving your applications! If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ciara Leonor P. Clarkin&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Salutations, New Jersey District Secretaries!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These next few months are an exciting time, but they move quickly. In these next few months, your clubs will likely be busy planning for District Convention, putting together last minute service projects, and supporting potential candidates for the positions of Lieutenant Governor or an Executive position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a secretary, your role in successfully completing the service year will be vital. Here are some things to keep in mind: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The AARF has been released and can be found in the December District Mailing. Completion of the AARF is required in order to receive any formal recognition at both District and International Convention. If you have been filling out your CMRFs every month, completing the AARF will be much easier. Make sure you work with your club presidents and advisors to ensure the AARF is accurate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a timeline to track entries for any District Convention contests. A Google Sheets Document will be helpful for this. Create a document with the names of the contests your club wishes to enter and the date it is due. (You may also want to include the deadline for the AARF.) Use one color to indicate that the contest has been completed and submitted (if it is a prejudged contest) and another to indicate the contest has been completed (if it is an at-DCON contest.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue filling out CMRFs on a monthly basis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply for a scholarship, and ensure that the scholarship packet is available to all officers and members that may wish to apply. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please contact me with any questions or concerns! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;br&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello New Jersey District!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you all are enjoying your holiday breaks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The December Mailing was sent to all clubs this month. Please make sure you &lt;strong&gt;thoroughly&lt;/strong&gt; go through it with your other officers and advisor. There are a lot of important documents in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LTG Elections are rapidly approaching! LTGs are district liaisons to clubs in the same division. They have a neat job because they get to work hands-on with people on the club and district levels. It is a great opportunity to know service oriented people like you and truly make a difference in New Jersey. All LTG Elections are being held sometime between mid-January and mid-February, depending on what division you are from. If you have any interest in becoming an LTG, contact your division’s LTG or Elections Chair Zierra Dean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCON is rapidly approaching! DCON is April 1st-3rd at the Ocean Place Resort and Spa in Long Branch, NJ. DCON is my &lt;strong&gt;favorite&lt;/strong&gt; Key Club event!!!! At DCON, you get to connect with other service oriented teens from across the state, listen to inspiring speakers, attend intriguing workshops, elect the district executives, spend time near the beach and more! This year’s theme will also make it a very fun convention. Also, John Shertzer is the Keynote Speaker this year which is extremely exciting!!! Mr. Shertzer is the Chief Programs Officer at Kiwanis International and gave an amazing presentation at ICON 2015. All of these exciting aspects are sure to make DCON 2016 one for the history books. The DCON Registration Packet was in the December Mailing. Start planning now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so great to meet so many amazing Key Clubbers at Key Leader earlier this month. I learned a lot and had so much fun as a student facilitator. Shout out to The Kind Kewl-olas!!!! If you aren’t graduating this year like me (tears), I strongly urge you to attend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spike Out Hunger tournaments have been widely successful at divisional tournaments across the state. Thank you so much to everyone who has supported the cause. Some divisions still have to have their tournaments so please be sure to organize a team and support hunger in NJ if this applies to you. The district tournament for divisional winners will be in mid-February at a Central NJ school. Everyone in the district is welcome to attend the district tournament. It is going to be a lot of fun to see these teams battle it out. I highly recommend attending this tournament if you are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The January Board Meeting is the weekend of January 9th and 10th. A lot of DCON planning is going to be happening there so be sure to be on the lookout for updates after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to share your Key Club Problems? Look at the NJ Key Club Twitter? Look at the NJ Key Club Twitter account after January 1st to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be sure to contact me with any questions and have a splendiferous day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;br&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Salutations, New Jersey District!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holidays are upon us! On behalf of the New Jersey District Board, we wish you all a happy, healthy holiday season, full of service and success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you enjoy celebrate this time with friends and family, please remember all those that will be in need of food this holiday season. There’s still time before winter to set up some last minute fundraisers, like bake sales, movie nights, and others, to benefit the New Jersey Federation of Food Banks, to feed those who are in most need. Use the time over the break to come up with fun, innovative ways to benefit the Federation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After break, we will have only 4 months remaining in the service year. With that being said, secretaries have a great deal of responsibility in the next few months. Here they are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, to fill out the Annual Achievement Report Form, or AARF. You should have received an electronic copy of the December District Mailing from the Lieutenant Governor. The Mailing consists of the AARF as well as other informational materials concerning District Convention. The AARF is a culmination of all your CMRFs (and therefore your accomplishments) for the service year. You MUST fill out the AARF to qualify for any District or International recognition. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with your club presidents and vice presidents to create a strategic plan on advertising and fundraising for DCON. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assist your club presidents and advisors in filing for DCON contests. Some are pre-judged, while others are judged at DCON. Help keep your club organized by keeping close track of dates and deadlines for these contests, as well as DCON registration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply for scholarships! New Jersey District of Key Club scholarships are available to all Key Clubbers. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, please feel free to reach out to me with any questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;br&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello New Jersey District!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The District just sent out three surveys, 2 from NJ and one from International: an officer feedback survey to give feedback for LTGs, the District Feedback and Improvements survey, and an officer survey from international. These surveys will help us operate better, but do not feel pressured to fill it out if you don’t have feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spike Out Hunger tournaments have been widely successful at divisional tournaments across the state. Thank you so much to everyone who has supported the cause. Some divisions still have to have their tournaments so please be sure to organize a team and support hunger in NJ if this applies to your division. The district tournament for divisional winners will be in mid-February so please be sure to be on the lookout for specifics about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCON will be from April 1st-3rd at the Ocean Place Resort and Spa in Long Branch, NJ. The theme is titled “License to Serve” and has a James Bond and Mission Impossible feel. We have a lot of exciting workshops, speakers, and activities planned so be sure to stay on the lookout for DCON updates.  I highly recommend attending!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The December Mailing will be sent out to all clubs soon. There are a lot of important district updates in it so please be sure to go through it thoroughly. Some highlights include the DCON Registration Packet, Elections Packet, Contests Packet, Scholarships Packet and more. It will be sent electronically and physically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we pass the halfway mark of the service year, we have to begin thinking about next year. Lieutenant Governor Elections will be hosted by your current LTG between mid-January and mid-February. If you have any interest in running, do not hesitate to contact your LTG. Executive Board Elections will occur at DCON and the webmaster will be appointed at DCON. Interested candidates must send a paper to Elections Chair by mid-February. Editor, Treasurer, Secretary, and Governor candidates will caucus, and give Zierra speeches at the convention and will be elected at the House of Delegates. Candidates cannot declare their candidacy or campaign prior to the Friday of DCON or else they endanger their candidacy. Webmaster candidates will fill out the application and interview with me. All details will be in the elections packet. If you have any questions regarding the elections process, please do not hesitate to contact me, your LTG, or Elections Chair Zierra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Leader is happening next weekend! Key Leader is a team building, leadership strengthening weekend in Port Murray, NJ. Registration is now closed, but be sure to sign up next year if you have an interest in attending. Be sure to keep up with the NJ District throughout the weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don’t hesitate to contact me with questions and have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;br&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Salutations, New Jersey District Secretaries!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few months will be busy ones for the New Jersey District! Here are some things the New Jersey District Board would look you all to keep in mind: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100% CMRF Award: To be eligible for the 100% CMRF Award, you must submit ALL CMRFs by November 10th, including the October CMRF. You are allowed to submit any missed CMRFs by this date as well. Feel free to contact your Lieutenant Governor or myself with any questions about this award. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out the Fall Rally board meeting summary! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin compiling a folder (if you have not already done so,) of all CMRFs, whether electronically or physically. A copy of a fillable Annual Achievement Report Form (AARF) will be included in the December Mailing; if all your CMRFs are in one place, it will be much easier to fill out the AARF and to get it done early! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to contact me with any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/governor's-blog/october-update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you all have been having an awesome week! Whether you have been stressing with college apps, school or sports, I hope you all have felt better with each service hour you’ve earned! The N.J. District just had our huge Fall Rally and has some important events coming up soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fall Rally was a big success! It was wonderful to see around 2,200 of you there ready to learn about what is going on in Key Club! All attendees attended a fun and informative session, cheered their heads off and listened attentively! Shout out to Division 8 for winning the spirit stick! I am very sad that this was my last Fall Rally. I highly encourage you all to attend Fall Rally next year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our District Project this year is The NJ Federation of Food Banks. The Federation works towards feeding the many food deprived people in our state. Please make sure you fill out the google form whenever you donate and record all service hours, donations and funds for the District Project correctly on the CMRF. It is extremely pertinent that you all do this so we can keep track of our district goals! As a clarification, if you give food directly to a food pantry, like if your school has a food pantry in it like mine, this still counts towards the goal and should still be recorded the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spike Out Hunger volleyball divisional tournaments are coming up super soon!!!! Please attend your divisional tournaments!!! You can play volleyball, eat food, and have fun while donating to a cause that feeds struggling people! This is the definition of a win-win situation! Why would you not want to go? Please contact your LTG so you can register you and your team ahead of time. Please contact me or your LTG with any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunger Awareness Week is also happening from November 9th-13th! Participate in the daily tasks to spread awareness about our District Project! Monday is paper sales! Print out paper cut outs and sell them for $1 each! Tuesday is $2 Tuesday! You can only spend $2 for lunch in school. Wear orange, the Student’s Change Hunger color, on Wednesday! Thursday is Informative Day! Hand out flyers out the Federation and Students Change Hunger during lunch! Friday is #FoodBankFriday –take photos and post with this hashtag to spread awareness for our district project! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Leader is an amazing experience! I have been twice and have taken key different lessons out of both experiences. At Key Leader, attendees learn about leadership techniques, team building and more all while having fun! I strongly encourage you all to attend. This year Key Leader is from December 4th-6th at Camp Cross Roads in Port Murray, NJ. The cost is $200, but if you sign up before November 21st, you get $25 off! Go to http://key-leader.org/ to sign up. NJ Key Leader registration is in the left column. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please contact me with any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;br&gt;

   <title>100% CMRF Award Information</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/secretary's-blog/100-percent-cmrf-award.html"/>
   <updated>2015-10-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/secretary's-blog/100-percent-cmrf-award</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello, NJ District! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is bittersweet to say that we are almost halfway through the service year. However, with the end of the service year brings District Convention, or DCON. DCON is a great chance to earn awards like the 100% CMRF Award. Throughout the service year, you have been working hard to compile the Club Monthly Report Form (or CMRF) for each month. The 100% CMRF Award allows clubs to be rewarded for their hard work and dedication in filling out CMRFs. Here are the basic rules: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALL CMRFs from the service year must have been submitted. If you have been sending your CMRFs on a monthly basis, there is no need to send all of them in once again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are missing any CMRFs, you can hand them in late and STILL be eligible for the 100% CMRF Award. For example, if you did not hand in your July CMRF, you may still send it in and be eligible for the 100% CMRF Award. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to make sure of what CMRFs you have sent in, please contact either District Secretary Farwa Shakeel at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com&quot;&gt;njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt; and/or myself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All CMRFs for the service year must be sent in by November 10th, including the October CMRF which is due on the same day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please send any missing CMRFs to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com&quot;&gt;njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the 100% CMRF Award is very easy to earn. If you have any questions, please contact myself or Secretary Farwa at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:secretary.shakeel@gmail.com&quot;&gt;secretary.shakeel@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Salutations, New Jersey District! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be hard to believe, but we are almost halfway through the service year! There are some things you must keep in mind as the service year winds down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is still time to hand in your CMRFs! Even if some CMRFs are late (even by a few months,) your club will still be eligible for the 100% CMRF Award at DCON. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The deadline to send in all CMRFs for the 100% CMRF award is November 10th. (This is also, conveniently, the deadline for the October CMRF!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please continue sending all CMRFs, including all the ones you may have missed, to njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com. This email will also be in effect for the next service year and moving forward, so please continue to send CMRFs there. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have not already done so, make a folder- either physical or electronic- containing just your CMRFs. This will come in handy when filling out the Annual Achievement Report Form (AARF). Remember, you MUST submit the AARF to qualify for any contests at District Convention. 

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A physical copy of the AARF will be in the December District Mailing and an electronic version will be sent by then as well. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work with your president, advisor, and club treasurer to make sure all records from fundraising and service projects are accurate. Again, this will make filling out the AARF much easier! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;br&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello New Jersey District!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot believe we are already halfway through the service year! It is crazy to think that it’s already been six months since I set out my goals as governor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ran I set out to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain communication with members of all branches of the K-Family.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a monthly blog on the district website to help bridge the gap between club and district.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help clubs grow through aiding lieutenant governors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve district events with new information and fun elements to increase district participation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oversee a large scale project for our new District Project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the New Jersey District the best of all the rest!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to say that since I created these goals, they are all in progress and are looking good! I have tried to attend as many K-Family events as I can, especially since that is part of my Governor’s Project. I have attended Circle-K and Kiwanis events, board meetings and conventions. I have also remained in contact with each organization’s respective governor. I have and plan on posting on my blog monthly. I have remained in constant contact with all LTGs. I made them create newsletter and DCM schedules to ensure that they were getting out information at good intervals. I also give them individualized feedback every month, answer all their questions and help them whenever and however I can. This has helped them become better LTGs and helped many clubs grow. RTCs and Fall Rally plans are proof of my fourth goal, but it nowhere near being accomplished. This year at RTCs, we brought in an outside speaker, started new workshops and overall improved their functionality. There are lots of plans for Fall Rally to make it exciting but be prepared to be blown away! I plan to refresh DCON this year as well. For my second to last goal, we are currently in the planning stages of our Spike Out Hunger volleyball tournaments! These will be a bi-divisional volleyball tournaments and anyone in your school can participate! The winner from each tournament will move on to the district tournament! All proceeds and donations will go to our district project. One will be held at a school near you sometime in late October or November! We are definitely on our way for goal number 6! Your dedication to Key Club makes our district so spectacular!
Some upcoming things before I sign off:
Fall Rally: If you don’t want to go, do you even Key Club? Fall Rally is the largest gathering of Key Clubbers where the district board hosts a session to update you all with Key Club happenings then you have the rest of the day to adventure in the park! Admission also includes Fright Fest! The early registration deadline passed, but it only costs $42 to attend! Your club may collect this registration ahead of time, but if not you just bring your money the day of. Please contact me or your LTG with any questions!&lt;br&gt;
Fall Rally Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwEpFrEg4Mk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RTCs: RTCs were extremely successful and all attendees certainly “Pumped Up the Volume of Service”! All attendees learned a lot and will be able to help grow their clubs! Missed this year’s RTCs? Don’t worry! There will be 2 RTCs in spring 2016 and 3 in the fall of 2016. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District Project Updates: Please look out for news about your division’s Spike Out Hunger volleyball tournaments! It will be sometime in your area in November. Start planning your team now! Also, Hunger Awareness Week information will be sent to your club very soon! Be on the lookout for this and get ready to spread awareness about the extent of hunger in NJ. Finally, we are running a fundraiser for the district project! Your LTG has orange pens that say “Hunger Isn’t Write”. Be indePENdent of your teacher’s writing utensils and buy a pen for $1! All proceeds will benefit our district project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something to keep in mind is tomorrow (October 1st) is the official start of the 2015-2016 service year for Kiwanis. Be sure to talk to your Kiwanis club’s new officers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please contact me with any questions and I look forward to seeing you at Fall Rally!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;br&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Salutations, New Jersey District Key Clubbers! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While summer may be coming to a close, the new school year also means a new Key Club service year! Over the summer, I have been working to make some changes that will further help out District. Here are some updates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This blog post will not be the only one- I plan to issue a blog post every month from now on, particularly for reference for club secretaries!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have edited the CMRF and created new CMRF instructions, as well as a new email specifically for CMRFs: njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Club Secretaries, here are some things to keep in mind as September continues:
- Create a template for your Minutes. There will be one included in this post and on the website, and you should receive it from your Lieutenant Governors shortly. 
- Use the CMRF to help guide your minute-taking! That way, it becomes much easier to fill out your CMRF and AARF (Annual Achievement Report Form) at the end of the year. 
- It’s not too late to hand in CMRFs! If you missed any CMRFs over the summer, you can still hand them in, and still be qualified for the 100% CMRF Award given at DCON. 
- Create an electronic folder with any pertinent files and share it with the rest of your club officers. This way, everything is easily accessible. This folder can include meeting minutes, agendas, registration forms, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you all great success in this upcoming service year. Please feel free to contact me with any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;br&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello NJ Key Clubbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you all have had awesome summers! School is right around the corner and that means Key Club is in the full swing of things again! Yay! In this blog post, you will find what has been happening in NJ Key Club and some important updates as we head back to school!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to School is an exciting time in the Key Club year! You have the opportunity to recruit lots of new members, have new projects, attend exciting district events and more! While recruiting members, inspire potential members with the same enthusiasm that keeps you involved! Do things that will bring students to your meetings like food, a cool mini service project and then impress them with what Key Club is all about to keep them coming! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Back to School Mailing was released in mid-August. A virtual copy was sent to all officers by August 29th and every school was mailed a physical copy which your school should receive soon. This mailing has lots of important information for upcoming events. Some really important files include Fall Rally Registration and RTC info. Please be sure to read through it thoroughly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Club Welcome Guide was sent to all club officers this month. This has a lot of useful info regarding district happenings and resources you can use for recruiting. I highly encourage you all to utilize this resource!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our August Board Meeting, we decided what our district event for our district project will be! This year, we will be hosting Spike Out Hunger Volleyball Tournaments to benefit the NJ Federation of Food Banks. Bi-division volleyball tournaments will be held and the winner of each tournament will move onto the district tournament! Have fun while helping our district project! Your LTG will be holding this tournament before the end of November. More details will be available via your LTG. Please contact him or her with any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NJ District is welcoming a new board member. Farwa Shakeel will be the District Secretary for the duration of the 2015-2016 service year. Farwa is a rising senior at Piscataway High School in division 11. She is the IP LTG of Division 11, a Robert F. Lucas Outstanding Lieutenant Governor’s Award recipient, past DPS Co-Chair, past Scholarships Committee chair, past Distinguished Club President of Piscataway High School and more! 
Regional Training Conferences are right around the corner!  Regional Training Conferences, also called RTC’s, are hosted each year to train general members, officers and advisors alike to become more effective leaders and servers of their home, school, and community. Through four individual sessions that include several workshops to choose from, Key Clubbers learn important aspects of their roles in the club. RTC’s hold informative workshops on district events, service and fundraising ideas, public speaking, and ways to get more involved with Key Club. All NJ Key Clubbers are encouraged to attend. Each officer must attend at least one Regional Training Conference in order to be recognized as a distinguished officer at District Convention. There will be an RTC on September 12th at West Deptford High School, September 13th at Phillipsburg High School, and September 19th at Millburn High School. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fall Rally is the largest gathering of NJ Key Clubbers at Six Flags Great Adventure to kick off a new school year of service! This year’s theme is “Oh the Service You’ll Do!”! Admission includes a fun and informative session, early admission to the park, and fright fest! Learn more about what is going on in Key Club while having fun! How much does it cost to get into this awesome event? Season pass holders can get in for $7 regardless of when you sign up. If your club does early registration, the cost is $37 per member. Late registration is $41 per member. It is sure to be a very fun day! Please contact your LTG with any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please contact me or your LTG with any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,

   <title>The ELEMONATE Challenge</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/outside-organizations/the-elemonate-challenge.html"/>
   <updated>2015-08-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/outside-organizations/the-elemonate-challenge</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Remember last summer when everyone was pouring buckets of ice cold water on their heads in support of ALS and each person nominated 3 other people to do the same challenge? You could either accept the challenge and also donate $10 (or more), or deny the challenge and donate $100. This summer, the Pacific Northwest District of Key Club has kick started a new challenge called the Elemonate Challenge to support the Eliminate Project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to take part in this challenge, you just need ¼ of a lemon and a camera or phone with video capabilities. Once you start the video, say your name and who you were nominated by, and nominate 3 other people (or organizations). Then on the count of 3, bite into the lemon and chew it fully through. When completed, we ask that you donate at least $1.80 towards the Eliminate Project. $1.80 is enough for a series of 3 vaccinations to save a mother and all of her future babies from Maternal Neonatal Tetanus, or MNT. MNT takes the life of a newborn child every 11 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 15th, the New Jersey District Board of Trustees participated in the Elemonate Challenge at their second board meeting of their terms. The New Jersey District Board of Trustees was nominated by Governor Josie Suddeth when she was at LeadCon and we decided to nominate all Key Clubbers in the entire New Jersey District. The Eliminate Project has been a large part of the K-Family in the past few years, especially in the New Jersey District of Key Club. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We challenged you to accept the Elemonate Challenge so cut up a lemon, grab a few friends, video your challenge, nominate a few friends, and then donate! Enjoy that sour lemon!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Teen Summer Institute 2015 Recap</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/announcements/teen-summer-institute-2015-recap.html"/>
   <updated>2015-08-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/announcements/teen-summer-institute-2015-recap</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, July 29th, Key Clubbers along with several other teens in the state attendedthe Community Food Bank of NJ&amp;#39;s Annual Teen Summer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day began with an advocacy workshop, which discussed about 1 of 6 people (49 million), do not have enough money to eat. One reason for this is household incomes are minimal, leaving families to choose whether to pa for rent, child care, health care transportation, and/or food. The day proceeded with volunteering in the Food Bank warehouse. In the warehouse, volunteers helped sort and pack food items for soup kitchens, pantries, and other social programs served by the FoodBank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the day continued, attendees learned how climate change affects food. Climate change can lower nutritional value in fruits and vegetables; it also reduces the amount of crops produced from a given amount of land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final workshop was about nutrition. When a family has an allotted amount of money to spend on three meals, it&amp;#39;s difficult to buy cheap nutritional meals. Many families resort to buying junk food instaed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THe overall institute experience was an eye-opening one. There&amp;#39;s so much that takes place when a hungry family tries to buy food for their loved ones, along with when a food bank provides for those in need. It was great to learn about the NJ District Project more in depth. With the help of everyone, maybe one day this world will be hunger free!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introduction: International Trustee Kacie Hines</title>

   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/governor's-blog/trustee-introduction</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello New Jersey District Key Clubbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Kacie Hines, and I am your International Trustee for the 2015-2016 year. Along with New Jersey, I will be serving the Wisconsin- Upper Michigan and Kentucky-Tennessee Districts. I am an upcoming senior at Vestavia Hills High School in Alabama, and I’m ecstatic to see what great joy and love for service the New Jersey District has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little bit about me and my Key Club story: I joined Key Club my freshman year, and I’ve loved every minute since. My favorite service project is going to my local Boy’s Ranch around the holidays with gifts. My favorite thing about Key Club is the fact I get to meet people from around the world who have the same passion to serve as I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a trustee, I am a liaison between the districts I serve and the International Board. I will be working primarily with the New Jersey District Board but am always open to help anything you may need! To get more connected with all members of New Jersey, I will be periodically posting blogs and keeping you up to date on International.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of International, next year International Convention will be in Atlanta, Georgia just a few short hours from me. It’s going to be an extraordinary weekend filled with workshops, dances, and keynote speakers. If you want to learn even more about Key Club, improve your leadership skills, or even just to meet new people who share your same passion, International Convention is the place for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the bottom of my big, southern heart, I hope you have a successful and impactful year as you continue making a difference in your homes, schools, and communities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in service,&lt;br&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are all having fantastic summers that are filled with service! Several important events have just happened so you can find recaps below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ICON 2015 was so much fun! All attendees learned a lot, strengthened their leadership skills, bonded with Key Clubbers and Kiwanis Family members from our district and the world, and more! Highlights included the Kiwanis Family Baseball Game, Key Club Opening Session, Kiwanis Opening and Closing Sessions, Cedar Point Amusement Park, and the Indianapolis Zoo! It was so cool to be with Kiwanis Family members as we celebrated Kiwanis’ 100th Birthday! Two amendments to our bylaws were passed during House of Delegates. These amendments need to be approved by Kiwanis International first so I will be sure to blog about the updates as soon as they are official. NJ K-Family members also had successful International Board Elections. Lance Incitti will be a three year Kiwanis International Trustee starting October 1st and Devin Sun will be a Key Club International Trustee until July 2016. Devin will be serving the Pacific Northwest, Carolinas, and Missouri-Arkansas Districts of Key Club International. I strongly recommend attending ICON 2016 in Atlanta! We already have exciting excursions planned and it is sure to be an exciting convention!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our International Trustee for the 2015-2016 Service Year was assigned to us recently. Kacie Hines of the Alabama District will be our trustee! I am super excited about this! Kacie and I have some goals in place that will have a positive impact on all members in our district. Her introduction letter will be on her blog on the district website which she will update periodically throughout the year soon. Kacie has a rich history in the Kiwanis Family. Kacie’s mom is a member of the Kiwanis Committee of the Alabama District of Key Club International so she has been attending K-Family events since she was little. Before becoming a trustee, Kacie was the Alabama District Webmaster for the 2012-2013 service year, Alabama District Media Tech and Technology Committee Chair for the 2013-2014 service year, and a Distinguished District Governor for the 2014-2015 service year! Some fun facts about Kacie are that she just learned how to ride a bike last week and she owns every Audrey Hepburn movie that she ever starred in! Please reach out to her if you have any questions regarding the international level of Key Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two weeks ago I was in Indianapolis with the rest of the International Council (the International Board and all the District Governors) for Leadership Conference! There we were able to discuss goals with our trustees, learn more leadership techniques, and grow as people! I had a lot of fun seeing the International Council again and setting goals with Kacie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many LTGs have been holding DCMs and trainings throughout the summer. Make sure you stay in the loop of what your LTG is doing so you definitely be ready for when school comes around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be sure to contact me or your LTG with any questions and I look forward to seeing you at upcoming district events!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,
Josie Suddeth
2015-2016 District Governor&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this post finds you in good spirits - ICON has begun! I am writing this post on the bus on the way to Indy. Today we went to Hershey’s Chocolate World and Magic Mountain in Columbus, Ohio. Tomorrow we will leave Columbus, Ohio and head to the actual convention. We will go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, participate in activities with the entire K-Family, elect the International Board, and more! With the election of the new International Board, we will get a new trustee in mid-July - keep on the lookout for ICON updates!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The K-Family Picnic is an annual event hosted by Circle K. There will be a service project, volleyball, and many other summer activities! It is July 19th from 10:30am-4pm at 100 Green Island Road Toms River, NJ 08573. There is a Facebook event page so just check that you are attending. It is going to be a lot of fun and I strongly recommend that you and your clubs attend!
Summer is upon us and I hope you all have exciting plans for the summer - summer is very different since it’s harder to meet with everyone, but there are certain activities that are always best during the summer: some ideas are lemonade stands, beach clean ups, gardens, and summer games.
Thank you so much for reading this, and please don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>American Cancer Society</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/outside-organizations/american-cancer-society.html"/>
   <updated>2015-06-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/outside-organizations/american-cancer-society</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society is an organization that works tirelessly to save lives and makes strides towards eradicating cancer. On May 23rd, 1913, 10 doctors and 5 laypeople in New York City founded the American Cancer Society (ACS), and it was initially called the American Society for the Control of Cancer (ASCC). Researchers funded by the ACS have contributed to nearly every major cancer research breakthrough that has been seen in almost 70 years since the start of ACS’s research program. They’ve helped establish the link between cancer and smoking; developed cancer-fighting drugs and biological response modifiers such as interferon; and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Key Clubber, there are many ways to help the American Cancer Society achieve their goal. Donating is obviously crucial to the success of any organization, especially to one fighting cancer.  However, personal donations are not necessary; soliciting funds from community members is a very effective way of raising funds. The American Cancer Society is well known for many of their events, such as Relay for Life, Making Strides for Breast Cancer, DetermiNation, and Coaches vs. Cancer.  The most renowned of their events is Relay for Life, which is an organized, overnight community walk. Teams are formed and they raise funds while members of each team take turns walking around the track. Camaraderie is built throughout the night through food, games, and activities with a family-friendly environment. Relay for Life events are very successful events, and a huge amount of fun to all of those who participate. A Key Club could help organize and recruit participants for a Relay for Life event (or any other American Cancer Society event), making it a huge community event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than one million people in the United States get cancer each year. As Key Clubbers, we can do as much as we can with volunteering at the many ACS events and through fundraising for their events. It is also important to remember that even though your Key Club may not be able to host an event, or very few American Cancer Society opportunities may arise near you, advocating is essential to the success of any organization. The use of social media, and first hand encouragement of others to get involved, can go a long way!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>District Project Steering: Students Change Hunger</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the Students Change Hunger / Public Relations subcommittee, we have been discussing ideas for clubs during the Students Change Hunger Challenge. The challenge will run from mid-September through mid-November. Public Relations will be creating advertising materials to spread word about the challenge when the time comes, and be the go-to people for any questions regarding the challenge. Although September seems far away, it&amp;#39;s closer than you think, so be sure to keep a look out for the Students Change Hunger Challenge in your school!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Public Relations Committee</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PR means telling the truth and working ethically - even when all the media want is headlines and all the public wants is scapegoats. Public relations fails when there is no integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Viv Segal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Public Relations Committee dedicates itself to promoting the ideals of Key Club. Through the use of flyers, videos, social media profiles on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and more, the committee serves to better connect the members of the New Jersey District of Key Club International as well as consistently provide the most recent, relevant information possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The committee consists of two subcommittees: Publicize and Inform. The Publicize subcommittee includes &lt;a href=&quot;/board/david.html&quot;&gt;District Editor David Guirgis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/board/shannon.html&quot;&gt;District Webmaster Shannon Peng&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/board/sarahp.html&quot;&gt;District Secretary Sarah Park&lt;/a&gt;. The Inform subcommittee includes &lt;a href=&quot;/board/priya.html&quot;&gt;Division 20 Lieutenant Governor Priya Lad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/board/mark.html&quot;&gt;Division 15 Lieutenant Governor Mark Ozdemir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/board/juan.html&quot;&gt;Division 4 Lieutenant Governor Juan Carlos Belmonte&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of May 2015, the Public Relations Committee has designed Facebook covers as well as filmed, edited, and published the promotional video for fall and spring Regional Training Conferences. It has designed a flyer listing the social media accounts of the district. The Public Relations Committee is currently working on developing brochures detailing information such as meeting ideas, dues, the District Project and advocacy focus, the Brand Guide, how to build a website and the resources that are available on the district site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ideas the Committee has in store for the future include a social media shoutout to a Member of the Week, implementing Snapchat geofilters and live events, and possibly using Periscope for large-scale events such as Fall Rally. The theme for Fall Rally will be “All the Service You Can Do”, inspired by Dr. Seuss, and the Public Relations Committee will begin an immersive campaign to promote the event beginning mid-summer.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Outside Organizations/Youth Opportunities Fund</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/the-outside-organizations-and-youth-opportunities-fund.html"/>
   <updated>2015-06-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/the-outside-organizations-and-youth-opportunities-fund</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Outside Organizations/Youth Opportunities Fund is a subcommittee in the standing committee International Programs. The Youth Opportunities Fund (YOF) is an endowed fund for Key Club International that provides funds to help Key Clubs execute their service opportunities. YOF grants can help your club perform the service project of your dreams; start looking around your school, community, or world for things that need improvement! Applications are due on October 15th at 11:59 EST each year – do not miss the deadline, there is only one funding cycle per year! Clubs may request financial assistance for said service project ranging anywhere from $100-$2000. The YOF committee usually allots the funds to clubs who ask for a portion of the total cost of the project, and to projects that are working with other organizations to fund and complete the project. The current application for the YOF grants can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;www.keyclub.org&quot;&gt;Key Club International site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other main focus of this subcommittee is Outside Organizations. Our main goal is to shed light on some of the wonderful organizations in the world that Key Clubbers can get involved with, yet it is not an organization specifically endorsed by the New Jersey District. By showcasing outside organizations, we are trying to spread the love for service on a greater scale and increase awareness for certain organizations. If you have any suggestions for outside organizations that should be encouraged to the New Jersey District, or have any questions regarding the Youth Opportunities Fund, feel free to contact Lieutenant Governor of Division 1 &lt;a href=&quot;/board/tom.html&quot;&gt;Thomas Beeby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>District Project Steering: Service</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the sub-committee Service, the committee works to keep track of the service conducted with the New Jersey Federation of Food Banks. It brainstorms possible service project ideas and determines the path that will most influence the district&amp;#39;s homes, schools, and communities. The committee also may coordinate Key Club Service days at the Food Banks but, mostly serve to ensure the district meets the service hour goal of 18,630 hours. 18 for the 1 in 8 people in New Jersey who struggle with hunger. 630 for the 630,000 children living in impoverished house holds.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>District Programs: Advocacy</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/district-programs-advocacy-subcommittee.html"/>
   <updated>2015-05-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/district-programs-advocacy-subcommittee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;###What does the Advocacy Subcommittee do?
The Advocacy Subcommittee focuses on raising awareness about the New Jersey District’s Advocacy focus. For the 2015-2016 service year, the New Jersey District Board collaboratively decided on the Advocacy focus being Autism. In other words, during this service year all the Key Clubs around New Jersey will be advocating for those who suffer from Autism. Autism was chosen for the advocacy focus because everyone is affected one way or another by Autism. Whether it’s one’s own sibling, child, friend or even just a student in your own school, Autism affects those around us one way or another. Because of this, Key Club can work with their school’s autism program to spread this advocacy focus to those unaware of how many people are truly affected by Autism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###So what is advocacy? 
Advocacy is speaking on behalf of others who cannot speak for themselves. The Lieutenant Governor of Division 16, Christine Jimenez, and Lieutenant Governor of Division 7, Julia Paco, correspondingly serve as the co-chairs for this subcommittee. Together they have helped mold the District’s Advocacy focus for the 2015-2016 service year, and they are always looking for new and better ways to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>District Programs: K-Family Relations</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/district-programs-kfamily-relations-subcommittee.html"/>
   <updated>2015-05-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/district-programs-KFamily-relations-subcommittee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just like K-Family Growth and Advocacy, K-Family Relations also branches off District Programs. This subcommittee is focused on the communication between Key Club and the Circle K and Kiwanis counterparts. The goal is to strengthen the relationships. K-Family Relations also provides event information, spreading the word of Key Club events to Circle K and Kiwanis as well as spreading their events through the NJ District of Key Club. This is to keep the flow of events for all K-Family branches spreading in the vine of service. In this subcommittee the main idea is to promote unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another part of being in the K-Family Relations subcommittee is the directives. As a subcommittee we are in charge of compiling a list of all the Kiwanis groups in New Jersey and the Key Clubs they sponsor. This is to provide an accurate directory where anybody can look to find out more information and increase the communication between their club and their sponsors or vice versa. K-Family Relations also compiles a directory of all the Circle K, Builders and K-Kids Clubs in New Jersey. This directory is also used to strengthen communication where there are these clubs all in the same area. The K-Family is exactly what is states, a family and we make a bigger difference in the world together. K-Family Relations strives for all the branches to come together for service projects and events, that is our purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>District Programs: K-Family Growth</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/district-programs-kfamily-growth-subcommittee.html"/>
   <updated>2015-05-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/district-programs-KFamily-growth-subcommittee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;K-family growth is a subcommittee of the District Programs committee. Its aim is to help other lieutenant governors charter clubs and to create a list of target schools for club chartering. As many of you know, Key Club is successful because of the hundreds of schools that have it. By making the effort to charter new clubs, we can help Key Club grow and make major changes in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Club chartering isn’t restricted to just building Key Clubs. We also aim to charter at least 1 K-Kids, 1 Builders Club, 1 Kiwanis, and 1 Circle-K before DCON 2016. We hope to achieve this by contacting the principals of schools, helping them find a club advisor, recruiting members, purchasing the club building kit, and acting as a source for chartering questions.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please don’t ever hesitate to ask me (Julian Maceren) at ltg11.maceren@gmail.com or Yasmine at ltg6.abed@gmail.com about any club chartering questions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/governor's-blog/may-update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!
I hope you all had an amazing month! I hope the stress of APs, Proms, and upcoming finals are soothed by recent and upcoming Key Club events!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2015-2016 New Jersey District Board and I met for our first official board meeting the weekend of April 18th. This meeting was extremely productive; we have lots of ideas and plans that will ensure a successful service year. As many of you know, the District Project for this year is The NJ Federation of Food Banks. We discussed a lot of ideas to involve you all and potential district wide events like last year’s Eliminathons. We encourage you all to fundraise, do service, and do food drives for your local food banks. Keep an eye out for new updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also decided that the advocacy focus will be Autism. We encourage you all to get involved with local events that help autism and with your school’s programs. Throughout the year, your LTG will inform you of events that the district is promoting and encouraging you to attend. On May 31st in Paramus NJ, Go the Distance for Autism will be happening. Run by Beth Callahan, who we will be working with this year, this event has multiple bike rides with different lengths and all the money will go to several different autism programs. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure3.convio.net/gtd/site/SPageServer/;jsessionid=A9AA3161CE19360F7F8FCDC33BAEA77D.app328a&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more or contact your lieutenant governor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional Training Conferences are events run by our district where attendees have the opportunity to attend a general session, attend fascinating workshops, eat 2 great meals, and get the chance to win Key Club prizes! These workshops range from specific officer positions to Fundraising Ideas, to How to Get More Involved in Your Division! They are especially helpful for new officers to learn more about their jobs, but general members get just as much if not more out of the experience. The first RTC was on May 9th at Morris County School of Technology! There was a great turn out and all attendees learned a lot! The next RTC will be on May 16th at Southern Regional High School from 9am-1pm. It is sure to be a great event. Remember, in order to be a distinguished officer, you must attend at least one RTC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also pleased to announce that my Governor’s Project this year will be K-Family Relations and K-Family Building. I think this is especially important since we are in Kiwanis’ 100th year and Key Club’s 90th year. The bond between K-Family bonds is so important. When you support each other, each club grows and changes more lives for the better. Also, by giving community members the opportunity to be involved with the K-Family, you give someone the opportunity to change the world. You would be part of the reason a club does all the good it does. How cool is that?  I will be doing more throughout the year to promote this. I encourage you all to get more involved with your nearby K-Family clubs and build new clubs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From April 30th-May 3rd, I attended the Governors and Administrators Training Conference (GATC) in Atlanta, Georgia. I was able to learn how to be a better governor, get international updates, meet all the other governors, have fun exploring Atlanta and more! We even stayed at the hotel where parts of The Hunger Games were filmed and where ICON 2016 will be! It was an unforgettable experience!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much for reading this! I can’t wait to see you all at upcoming district events!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josie Suddeth&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>International Convention 2015</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/announcements/international-convention-2015.html"/>
   <updated>2015-05-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/announcements/international-convention-2015</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;International Convention has a reputation for being the largest Key Club event of the service year. This year is not any kind of exception to the reputation of International Convention, but has an expectation of being even more of a once in a lifetime event than ever. This summer the New Jersey District will be traveling to Indianapolis, Indiana to the Key Club International 72nd International Convention to celebrate the 100th service years of Kiwanis International. For this centennial celebration there will not only be the Key Club International Convention, but a joint International Convention with Key Club, Circle K, and Kiwanis. Indianapolis, Indiana is rated USA Today’s best convention city in the United States and we will be celebrating there with an expected 12,000 attendees. The 2015 International Convention being described as splendiferous would be an understatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2015 not only marks the centennial birthday of Kiwanis International, Key Club’s parent organization, but also an end to the ELIMINATE project campaign. At International Convention we will be celebrating the achievements of Key Club International for fundraising for the ELIMINATE project. As of 2015 Kiwanis International has raised $80 million towards ELIMINATE to help with efforts towards eradication maternal and neonatal tetanus and the disease has been eradicated in 16 countries as of April 2015. The accomplishments of the clubs of the New Jersey District over the past years with the ELIMINATE campaign will be recognized and are very much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Convention can be a beneficial opportunity for many reasons. The convention can be used as an opportunity to make business connections with service organizations represented at the convention and with other Key Clubbers in attendance. At International Convention the next International Board of Trustees will be elected for the 2015-2016 service year. At the House of Delegates, attendees from each school will be voting on amendment to the bylaws of Key Club International. In this way and many more, International Convention is a way to see the way Key Club’s International level works and help set the stage for the new service year. Not only business connections but friendships and memories to last a lifetime will be in store at the 2015 International Convention. All attendees are sure to have the experience of a lifetime at the 72nd Key Club International Convention!&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2015-04-13T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/governor's-blog/april-update</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Josie Suddeth and I am extremely honored and excited to serve as your District Governor for the 2015-2016 Service Year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As promised in my campaign, I will be posting a monthly blog on the New Jersey District Website. I hope to further bridge the gap between club and district, and let you know what the district is up to through this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I will be your District Governor this year, I want to give you a little brief overview of who I am. The way to success is when the leader works as his or her followers. I want to be as relatable and approachable as possible. If you want to learn even more about me and my goals for this year, go to the board tab on the website, click on me, and read my Letter of Introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Name: Josie Suddeth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past Key Club Positions: Lieutenant Governor of Division 7, Vice President, Historian&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite Colors: Light blue, pink, lime green, and lavender&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theme Song: Walking on Sunshine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite Book: The Hunger Games Series by Suzanne Collins&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite Movie: The Parent Trap&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite Song: I Lived by One Republic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite Food: Apple Crisp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite Quote: “It doesn’t matter where you go, but what you do when you are there.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite Key Club Service Project: My club held a joint project with Pennsylvania K-Family members my freshman year to help with Hurricane Sandy Relief. We had a 2 mile beach clean-up, gave cupcakes to emergency responders, and ran a lunch for those still displaced by the storm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funniest Key Club Moment: At Midwinter 2014, my room’s alarm clock didn’t go off and we had to rush to get to the session on time. I whipped out running while on the way to the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Favorite Key Club Event: I can’t pick just one! They are all so fun, informative and unique in their own respective ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was amazing seeing a lot of you at DCON 2015! I hope you enjoyed the experience as much as I did. DCON 2016 will be even more exciting; I hope to see all underclassmen there next year!
The most important thing the District Board is working on right now is Regional Training Conferences.  Regional Training Conferences are events run by our district where attendees have the opportunity to attend a general session, attend fascinating workshops, eat 2 great meals, and get the chance to win Key Club prizes! These workshops range from specific officer positions to Fundraising Ideas, to How to Get More Involved in Your Division! They are especially helpful for new officers to learn more about their jobs, but general members get just as much if not more out of the experience. Regional Training Conferences are quickly approaching! While the exact locations are not yet solidified, one will definitely be held in southern New Jersey and the other in northern New Jersey. The dates for the two Spring RTCs are May 9th and May 16th and they will both be from 9am-1pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another exciting event happening in the Key Club world is International Convention. This year International Convention is in Indianapolis, Indiana (the best city in the country to hold a convention). International Convention is kind of like DCON but 100 times better and bigger. Attendees attend general sessions, attend caucus sessions, elect the International Board, attend workshops, explore the host city, mingle with Key Clubbers from all over the world, and so much more. On top of the educational part of ICON, attendees will attend a block party, attend a minor league baseball game, attend the largest pancake breakfast ever, and attend a private Hello, Goodbye concert and more! This year is particularly exciting because it is the 100th anniversary of Kiwanis International. Kiwanis, Circle K, and Key Club are holding one joint International Convention. ICON is the must go to event of the Key Club year! For New Jersey Key Clubbers, ICON will begin on June 23rd and end June 30th. On top of the exciting ICON schedule, our district will travel to Hershey Park in Hershey, Pennsylvania; Columbus, Ohio; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio; and Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky, Ohio! I will be attending and I hope to see you there as well. The first payment is due by May 8th to District Administrator Ms. McCann. If you would like the registration packet, please contact your Lieutenant Governor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some exciting things I specifically have and will be doing are the following. I have been busily and happily working with all aspects of the District to make sure we start off on the right foot! These range from talking to board members, planning committee work, and planning RTCs! I will be attending the Governor’s and Administrator’s Training Conference in Atlanta, Georgia in about 2 weeks where I will learn how to better serve you. The District Board has its first official board meeting this weekend. Be on the lookout for updates from this meeting!
Thank you for reading this blog post and I look forward to seeing you at upcoming district events!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours in Caring and Service,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Josie Suddeth&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Salutations, New Jersey District Key Clubbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it may seem like the service year just began, it is quickly coming to a close!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many of you, this year will be the last for your Key Club career. Fortunately, you have the opportunity to be rewarded for your dedication to Key Club! Each year, the New Jersey District grants 14 different scholarships, each ranging between $1,000-$2,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All information is located in the scholarship packet. You can ask your Lieutenant Governor for a packet, but here is a quick breakdown of what you need to include in your application:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A two page essay detailing your favorite Key Club service project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two letters of recommendation from adults who are familiar with your service, neither of which can be a relative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advisor verification of your service, especially if you must approximate your number of hours/points, in the case that your club does not record hours/points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brief description of all your service, inside and outside of Key Club, and your greatest achievement outside of Key Club.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All scholarship applications must be postmarked by February 20th, 2015. Any application not postmarked by this date will not be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to Get Animated with Service at Fall Rally 2014? What is Fall Rally? Fall Rally is the largest gathering of NJ Key Clubbers to motivate Key Clubbers to have a great rest of the service year. This year Fall Rally will be on October 12th at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey. In the wee hours of the morning you and your Key Club will travel to the amusement park to meet about 3,000 Key Clubbers from all across New Jersey! Get ready to see the NJ District Board dress up as your favorite animated characters ranging from Aang to Wanda! Get ready to learn all about what the New Jersey District is doing ranging from Eliminate updates, Advocacy information, dues, and different district events during the session!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another highlight of the event will be the spirit stick competition! Every division will have to prove how ready they are for the service year as they cheer their heads off hoping to be the loudest division in the district! The winner will win the coveted spirit stick! The day does not have to end with this fun session! Clubs have the option to explore the park and go on the rides before the park officially opens! Your club will also have the option to stay for Fright Fest.
Although Fall Rally is on October 12th, Key Clubs should start preparing now! You should be sure to stress the importance of attending Fall Rally from the start of the school year and then talk to your current Lieutenant Governor or any District Board member about how many people your club will be taking to Fall Rally or if there is an issue or concern regarding transportation, etc. Fall Rally is great way to get to know people who share the same passion for service as you, meet the members of the New Jersey District Board, and have lots of fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Registration:&lt;/strong&gt; $37.00&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Spring Regional Training Conferences Recap</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/announcements/spring-rtcs-recap.html"/>
   <updated>2014-06-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/announcements/spring-rtcs-recap</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This year’s Spring Regional Training Conferences were a success. The hard work of the host clubs and the New Jersey District Board members who helped choreograph the events paid off as Key Clubbers from all over New Jersey successfully learned the ins and outs of everything Key Club. The Spring Regional Training Conferences were held in Roxbury for the Northern session on May 4, 2014, and in Cedar Creek (co-hosted by the Cedar Creek and Absegami Key Clubs) for the Southern session on May 10, 2014. Both ran from 9 am to 1 pm, with every minute full of learning and laughter. The RTC theme this service year is Greek/Roman mythology, as the New Jersey District is trying to climb Mount Service! The host clubs did a spectacular job in decorating their school to fit the theme. Their hard work with decorations helped provide Key Clubbers the ultimate experience at the conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with theme-related decorations, Key Clubbers attended creative workshops, such as &lt;em&gt;Bringing in the Drachmas: Fundraising and Speaking like Roman Emperor: Public Speaking&lt;/em&gt;. The workshops were all split up into three sessions, each one also named to correspond with the theme. The first session, Session Alpha, referred to the first letter of the Greek alphabet. Session Mu, the second session, was named after the twelfth and middle letter of the Greek alphabet. The last session, Session Omega, referred to the last letter of the Greek alphabet. A wide variety of workshops were given during each session, from workshops that taught club officers about their positions to ones that explained how general members can get involved to workshops that addressed the district projects for this service year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people attended the spring conferences, and each person had their own great and unique experience. Kenneth Ye, President of Egg Harbor Township Key Club in Division 2, said, “The Spring RTC’s were invigorating and eye-opening with the variety of workshops and events for officers and fellow Key Club members! It was truly amazing experience that allowed me to gain further knowledge and skills to help me with my position in Key Club, and it was great to meet everyone around our area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After such a great spring session, the NJ District Board has high expectations for an even better fall session! The Fall Northern RTCs will be on September 20, 2014; Central RTCs will be on September 14, 2014; and Southern will be on September 13, 2014. While club officers are required to attend a Regional Training Conference in order to be distinguished, all Key Clubbers are encouraged to attend a Fall RTCeven if they already attended one in the spring! There will be exciting icebreakers, updated information, and new workshops like “You, Your Ltg., and Your Division” and “Get that Olympic Gold: Contests and DCON,” all of which promise a day of useful information and many smiles.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The International Programs Committee</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/the-international-programs-committee.html"/>
   <updated>2014-06-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/the-international-programs-committee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-brief-introduction-to-the-international-programs-committee&quot;&gt;A brief introduction to the International Programs Committee&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Programs is the focus of Key Club on a global scale. It takes the core values and enthusiasm from Key Clubbers and extends it across the country. From teaching members at Key Leader and ICON to connecting with outside organizations such as UNICEF, the International Programs Committee seeks to spread the message of Key Club to other communities. It combines the service of members with the assistance and dedication of partner organizations to better assist the entire world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-various-subcommittees-of-the-international-programs-committee&quot;&gt;The various subcommittees of the International Programs Committee&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;icon&quot;&gt;ICON&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/board/thomas.html&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Governor Thomas Michael&lt;/a&gt; has been working on the International Convention subcommittee for International Programs, and so far, he has created an ICON flyer for each Lieutenant Governor to send out to their clubs. With some help from &lt;a href=&quot;/board/nathaniel.hml&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Governor Nate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/board/latifa.html&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Governor Latifa&lt;/a&gt; he was able to establish a very nice flyer for our district mailing. He will be attending ICON and will be prepared to write a recap on our adventure in California. Additionally, Thomas is working on a trifold for the ICON service fair! ICON is very rapidly approaching and Thomas is very excited for the great experiences he will have there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unicef&quot;&gt;UNICEF&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Club International has three main service partners, one of which being UNICEF. It is the only organization from the United Nations that focuses on children nearly exclusively. UNICEF shares the Kiwanis family’s universal dedication to children and service by providing extensive resources and leadership to help eliminate Iodine Deficiency Disorder (IDD) permanently. Over the years, Key Club has been a primary advocate of UNICEF. Since 1994 Key Club has raised almost $5 million towards the elimination of Iodine Deficiency Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Club and the other branches of the Kiwanis family are working with UNICEF for the Eliminate Project. The Eliminate Project is a global campaign to raise money to eliminate maternal and neonatal tetanus from the world. Tetanus is a deadly disease that comes from spores in the dirt. During unsafe birthing routines, these spores are able to enter the mother and baby’s bodies causing infection. The first few hours of the baby’s life is filled with excruciating pain and sensitivity to even a mother’s touch. Key Club’s goal is to raise $110 million by the end of the 2015 service year. The most popular way Key Clubbers work with UNICEF is in fall with Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF. During October, leading up to Halloween, Key Clubbers collect loose change from students throughout school days and they also ask for change instead of candy when they go Trick-or-Treat. Some even establish competition to see who can raise the most money! Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF can happen almost anytime you go out or see your friends, so always have your little box by your side!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF although the most popular is not the only way to raise money for UNICEF. Clubs can implement their own ideas to raise funds for such a great cause!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;march-of-dimes&quot;&gt;March of Dimes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;March of Dimes is an organization that works to raise both money and awareness about thousands of premature births that happen every year. There are walks organized by March of Dimes set to raise funds and awareness. All that is required of members is to walk with both friends and strangers toward the common goal. March of Dimes has supported causes spanning from the fight against polio to defending babies and mothers. The program was established by FDR over fifty years ago, and continues to raise awareness and funds for its goals. The money they raise is used for research that helps to protect babies and mothers everywhere. This year our district intends to raise $8,100.  This represents that out of every 8 babies to be born, 1 will be premature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join the March! Walks take place during the spring and there should be a one near you. If you can get at least 18% of your club to attend, you will win an award at District Convention! Bring as many people as you can- friends, family, peers- to stand together and take part in the March!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-children&amp;#39;s-miracle-network&quot;&gt;The Children&amp;#39;s Miracle Network&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Children&amp;#39;s Miracle Network is one of Key Club&amp;#39;s three preferred charities. CMN is an non-profit organization that works around the world to raise funds for children&amp;#39;s hospitals, medical research, and community awareness. They have given over $4 billion to over 170 hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Club works to help these hospitals by volunteering to spend time with patients and raise money through various fundraisers. Currently, the New Jersey District focuses on Children&amp;#39;s Specialized Hospital, that has locations in Toms River, Egg Harbor Township, Clifton, Fanwood, Hamilton, Mountainside, New Brunswick, and Roselle Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our service goal for Children&amp;#39;s Miracle Network Hospitals is 1,704 hours of volunteering. The 4 represents the $4 billion donated, and the 170 represents the 170 hospitals that are a part of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only will volunteering make the day of a patient, it will make yours as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relay-for-life&quot;&gt;Relay for Life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May is Cancer Awareness Month. One major event during this time is Relay For Life, run by the American Cancer Society. This community event allows everyone to remember those who have passed, remember those have beat their battle, and to fundraise for the costs of medical care and research to end this terrible disease. Held in over 20 countries in over 5000 events, Relay For Life has more than 4 million people participate annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can my Key Club help fight cancer through Relay for Life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clubs can make teams and raise money. Not only would you be fundraising, but it would also be a social event. Promote the ability to have fun, walk, and talk during the Relay. Key Clubbers can also serve on the committee to help plan the actual event. To publicize the event, clubs can also “paint the town purple” to spread awareness for cancer and get the word out about the local Relay for Life.  Southern Regional in Manahawkin runs the Survivors Dinner in which cancer survivors are fed and view centerpieces relating to the theme. They also paint their school purple by putting “I CAN” signs up and by changing the bulletin board paper to purple. This annual event not only creates plenty of hours, but it also makes the Key Clubber feel good about helping to fight such a terrible illness. For more information about Relay for Life or an event near you, visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.relayforlife.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.relayforlife.org/&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-leader&quot;&gt;Key Leader&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Leader is a Kiwanis-run educational program that provides life-changing experiences to teach students about how to become better leaders through various workshops, team building exercises, a ropes course, and so much more. Another important part of this event is that all attendees are broken into teams, or “neighborhoods,” made up of students from around the area. This allows you to meet new people and forge new connections while simultaneously building your skills as a leader. This event is open to all high school students and 8th graders looking to become better servant leaders. Key Leader will be held from December 5th-7th at Cross Roads Camp in Port Murray, New Jersey. The cost for this weekend is $200 and includes great food, rooming, and obviously fun. Key Clubbers receive a discount, and if you have been to the event before, you can apply to be a student facilitator to receive an additional discount. Registration is completed online. For more information about Key Leader, ask your Lieutenant Governor or visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.key-leader.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.key-leader.org/&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;yof&quot;&gt;YOF&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Youth Opportunity Organizations or Outside Organizations is a subcommittee regarding the International Programs committee. As members of this subcommittee, our main goals are to spread the word about other outside organizations that we do not specifically endorse as a District and to promote the Youth Opportunities Fund. This fund allows members serve the world by providing grants for service opportunities that may need more funding. We are also responsible for speaking about an outside organization at Fall Rally in order to spread the word to over 3,000 Key Clubbers about another worthy charity. We  spread the word of our subcommittee through articles like this when asked by District Webmaster Srikar or District Editor Patrick and create flyers to be distributed to the district. Regarding our service to lieutenant governors, we create flyers and articles to be distributed in their newsletters so that their divisions can learn about the world of different charities regularly. In summation, we work together to serve the New Jersey District and spread the word that there is a world of charities and people that need our help beyond the charities specifically endorsed by the New Jersey District. We are spreading the love of service on a broader scale. If you have any questions regarding the Youth Opportunities Fund or if your club is looking for an upcoming, worthy charity to help, please contact &lt;a href=&quot;/board/josie.html&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Governor Josie Suddeth&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The District Project Steering Committee</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/the-district-project-steering-committee.html"/>
   <updated>2014-06-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/the-district-project-steering-committee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Salutations, Key Clubbers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-this-year&amp;#39;s-district-project?&quot;&gt;What is this year&amp;#39;s District Project?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, the New Jersey District has once again chosen the ELIMINATE Project as the District Project! The ELIMINATE Project is a global effort to eradicate maternal and neonatal tetanus, a life-threatening disease that takes the life of one baby every 9 minutes, from this world. A baby that is infected with tetanus only lives between 3 and 7 days, dying after suffering excruciating pain and sensitivity to light and touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-the-kiwanis-family-doing-to-help?&quot;&gt;What is The Kiwanis Family doing to help?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Kiwanis International teamed up with the ELIMINATE Project to help in the effort to rid the world of tetanus. With 25 countries remaining still afflicted with the disease, and one more year left in the ELIMINATE Project campaign, Kiwanis and Key Club International are making their best efforts to help the Project reach its goal. Each year, the District Project Steering (DPS) Committee decides on a fundraising goal for the District!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-this-year&amp;#39;s-fundraising-goal?&quot;&gt;What is this year&amp;#39;s fundraising goal?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, the Committee has set a fundraising goal of: $109,325.15, representing the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10: For 2010, the year Kiwanis and the ELIMINATE Project joined forces to eradicate tetanus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9: For the one baby that dies of tetanus every 9 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3: For the series of 3 vaccinations needed to immunize a mother and her future babies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25: For the 25 countries that remain affected by MNT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;15: For 2015, the year the ELIMINATE Project campaign ends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DPS Committee is responsible for monitoring and encouraging fundraising all over the district, keeping track of progress being made on the fundraising goal. ELIMINATE Week is also the responsibility of DPS. The committee comes up with an activity for each day of the week, whether it be showing off the ELIMINATE spirit or raising funds for the project. All clubs are encouraged to participate in ELIMINATE Week and host as many fundraisers as possible this service year, not only to help reach the District fundraising goal but also to benefit the ELIMINATE Project to the fullest in the last year of its campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck and happy fundraising, New Jersey District!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The District Programs Committee</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/the-district-programs-committee.html"/>
   <updated>2014-06-01T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/committee-and-subcommittee-reports/the-district-programs-committee</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-the-district-programs-committee?&quot;&gt;What is the District Programs Committee?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The District Programs Committee focuses on advocacy and the entire K-Family relationship. The committee chooses the advocacy focus for the service year for the entire New Jersey District of Key Club International. It also works to organize and strengthen relations between the different K-Family Branches in the New Jersey District. District Programs is comprised of three subcommittees: Advocacy, K-Family Growth, and K-Family Relations. Co-chairs of this committee are &lt;a href=&quot;/board/tara.html&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Governor Tara Engelken of Division 9&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/board/brooke.html&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Governor Brooke Willemstyn of Division 10&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-does-the-advocacy-subcommittee-do?&quot;&gt;What does the Advocacy Subcommittee do?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Advocacy Subcommittee is focused on raising awareness about the district advocacy project which is hunger in the United States. It aims towards conducting service projects rather than fundraising. Through hands-on projects and advocacy, the campaign strives to make a difference in the district on the topic of hunger. &lt;a href=&quot;/board/dianna.html&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Governor Dianna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/board/devin.html&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Governor Devin&lt;/a&gt; of Divisions 2 and 12 respectively serve as co-chairs to this subcommittee. They have helped shape the focus for the 2014-2015 service year, and are looking into the ways to expand upon it. Alongside working with Students Change Hunger, a competition created by the Federation of New Jersey Food Banks to challenge students to raise food for the less fortunate, Dianna and Devin are looking into several other creative options to raise awareness for domestic hunger, and are sure to make great strides this service year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-does-the-k-family-growth-subcommittee-do?&quot;&gt;What does the K-Family Growth Subcommittee do?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K-Family Growth strives to create new K-Family clubs. Whether it’s a Key Club, K-Kids Club, Builders Club, or another branch, the purpose is to increase the number of service clubs throughout the district. The goal is to create 1 Kiwanis, 1 Key Club, 1 K-Kids, and 1 Builders Club by District Convention 2015. &lt;a href=&quot;/board/alex.html&quot;&gt;Alex Marino&lt;/a&gt;, Lieutenant Governor of Division 1, has begun to seek out target clubs to further expand the New Jersey District. He hopes to exceed the required goal of created clubs, and we believe he will undoubtedly succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-does-the-k-family-relations-subcommittee-do?&quot;&gt;What does the K-Family Relations Subcommittee do?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K-Family Relations’ goal is to strengthen the relationship between the K-Family clubs in the New Jersey District. They promote events with other branches of the K-Family and keep the circle of K-Family information flowing through out the district. Chair &lt;a href=&quot;/board/bobbie.html&quot;&gt;Bobbie Boettinger&lt;/a&gt;, Lieutenant Governor of Division 19 has worked feverishly in assembling directories, contacting Circle K, and working on events hoped to be held later on in this service year. She hopes to expand these connections so the New Jersey District can see projects incorporating every branch of the K Family.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>LTG Division 10 Says Hello!</title>
   <link href="http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/announcements/ltg-division-10-says-hello.html"/>
   <updated>2014-04-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://njkeyclub.org/news/blog/announcements/ltg-division-10-says-hello</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! My name is Brooke Willemstyn, the appointed lieutenant governor of division 10 of the great NJ District. This year, I&amp;#39;ll try to stress communication from the district level to the club level, and keep all my presidents as informed as they can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;attention-club-officers-of-division-10!&quot;&gt;Attention Club Officers of Division 10!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have officially called you out for this service year. Make your general members feel important. They are the essence of Key Club! I am responsible to flow information from the district level, to the club officer level, but I need to be certain you don&amp;#39;t stop the flow there. Other members need to know what&amp;#39;s going on in order to want to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;attention-club-officers-of-the-nj-district&quot;&gt;Attention Club Officers of the NJ District&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of you are lucky in sliding by with a lazy lieutenant governor. The board this year is absolutely fabulous, and they will be on top of everything you do, so don&amp;#39;t let them down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-expect-(division-10-specific)&quot;&gt;What I Expect (Division 10 Specific)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect you forward my newsletters, flyers, and all informational or promotional files to your clubs. I require that everyone fills out the forms I send early, and at worst on time. If that means the secretary is on vacation in Guatemala for a month, either your club CMRF is in before she leaves, or another officer is filling out the club monthly report form for that month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-you-should-expect&quot;&gt;What You Should Expect&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should expect change. You should be seeing some of the ideas your club has envisioned being realized on the district level. Expect me to communicate with you, and for Division 10 to have the best divisional projects in the district.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading this post, be professional, responsible, and lead this division 10 and our NJ District towards success this service year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! This is your District Webmaster Srikar, and I am proud to announce that the new district website has been released!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what&amp;#39;s-different?&quot;&gt;What&amp;#39;s Different?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of design, not much has changed since the last version of the website. I greatly appreciate the design skills of our former webmaster, Yuya Jeremy Ong. However, I have added several new features to the website that make it even easier to access and gain information from! The following is a list of those changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The website is now mobile-friendly. What does this mean you ask? Well, now you can browse the district website on small screens without having to scroll around and zoom in and out. In short, the contents of the website fit to any screen that you may have. Try resizing your browser now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each district board member now has their own blog! You can see the posts of a member by clicking on their name in the &lt;a href=&quot;/board/&quot;&gt;board section of our website&lt;/a&gt;! For example, click &lt;a href=&quot;/board/srikar.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see my posts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also find the contact information and introduction letter of a member on the same page as the blog posts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a new calendar page on the website which has a Google Calendar. This calendar will be updated with various district events, so it&amp;#39;s a good idea to sync it with your phone and computer!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now find Key Clubs near your location by visiting the &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/district-map&quot;&gt;District Map Page&lt;/a&gt;! Once the page loads, allow it to access your location and soon, you will see a map with markers indicating Key Clubs near your current area. Try zooming in and out of the map to find more Key Clubs!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I added a new &lt;a href=&quot;/quotes&quot;&gt;Quotes Page&lt;/a&gt; which includes several inspirational quotes that the District Board and Key Clubbers have found! Have a new quote? Send it to my email (&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:njwebmastersrikar@gmail.com&quot;&gt;njwebmastersrikar@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;) with the subject line &lt;em&gt;New Quote For District Website&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key Clubbers can comment on blog posts now! Please note that comments are approved by the District Board before they are posted. This system is in place to prevent spam comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;help-me-out!&quot;&gt;Help Me Out!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am only human and therefore make mistakes! If you find any errors or have suggestions for &lt;strong&gt;anything&lt;/strong&gt; at all, please email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:njwebmastersrikar@gmail.com&quot;&gt;njwebmastersrikar@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
