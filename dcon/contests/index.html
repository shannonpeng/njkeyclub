		<h1 class="uppercase expand">Chairperson's Welcome</h1>

		<p>Are you ready to get your license to serve at DCON 2016? As Contests Committee Chairperson, I am proud to present you with the 2015-2016 Contests Packet. Although it may seem intimidating at first, I assure you that it is not a lengthy read. Simply look through the Table of Contents for the contests you and your club are interested in and be sure to read the General Guidelines. Good luck to all!</p>

		<p>Competing in contests are great opportunities for any club to  gain recognition on a state&mdash;or even international level&mdash;for its wonderful achievements in service, fundraising, and creativity. In addition, individual Key Club members can enter various contests to showcase their leadership and dedication to this organization such as the oratorical speech or impromptu essay contest. With over twenty contests in total, there is a contest that suits everyone. So please take the initiative and apply for at least one contest!  Not only will you gain valuable experience, it will make your overall DCON 2016 experience better!</p> 

		<p>In the Contests Packet is a general description of all events, requirements, rules, regulations and deadlines for submissions. There are different submission requirements and deadlines for each of the events so please read   carefully! Some contests such as the District Project Award do not require an entry form but do have an early deadline for monetary submission. Other contests such as the Dominico Gatti Faculty Advisor Award have several parts in the submission packet. Members wishing to participate in the oratorical, talent, and impromptu essay contests should register at DCON but come prepared with the necessary materials.</p>

		<p>The Table of Contents has been divided up in order to divide each set of contests up by deadlines. For a complete list, you can also check out the Contests Calendar on Page 6 of the Contests Packet. The Early Contests which do not require any application form have individual deadlines for monetary submission very early in the Service Year. Next on the calendar are the nominations for the Awards of Appreciation. These are due on February 26th at the residence of Zone Administrator Mrs. Helene Miesner (see Page 5 of the Contests Packet). The deadline that follows is March 7th for the Prejudged Contests. Lastly, many contests are due on the Friday night of DCON on April 1st. Lastly, please remember that all deadlines are dates by which all materials must be <i>received</i>, not postmarked.</p>

In addition, a copy must be given to your respective Lt. Governor. If you are not attending Convention, it must still be submitted. A copy of this year’s report form is included in the November District Mailing, and can be given to you by your respective Lt. Governor. Failure to submit the Annual Achievement Report Form by Friday of DCON will result in disqualification from all other contests.</li>
			<li>All contest entries that are not prejudged must be handed in upon your club’s arrival at District Convention. These entries must be submitted no later than 5:00 pm on Friday, April 1st , 2016. Please note that no late entries will be accepted!</li>

All entry forms and explanations of these contests are in the Contests Packet, the 2015-2016 Guidebook, and on the Key Club International Website (www.keyclub.org).</li>
			<li>All information on all the contests should be typed or neatly hand written. Make sure you obtain all required signatures and get them sent in time or the entry will be disqualified.</li>
			<li>We encourage you to enter as many contests as possible. Although they may differ, the applicant pool for every contest is small when compared to the number of clubs in the District. In fact, contests are one of the most underutilized resources available to all clubs! Therefore, everyone has a chance at winning. Your chances of winning increase just by participating!</li>
			<li>All deadlines are the RECEIVED date, NOT the postmark date.</li>
			<li>Winning entries become the property of Key Club International and will not be returned. Key Club International reserves the right to reproduce winning entries for any use deemed appropriate by Key Club International. Appropriate recognition will be provided to the winning Key Club.</li>
