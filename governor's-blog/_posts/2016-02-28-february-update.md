Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!

I hope you all have had a great month serving your homes, schools, and communities! NJ Key Club has had a great month!

DCON is so soon!!!! Please remember that DCON Registration needs to be postmarked by Friday. DCON is such a fun learning experience and I recommend anyone who has a slight interest to attend! The District Board and I have been very busy preparing for DCON to ensure its success. Please do not hesitate contacting me or your LTG about further inquiries.

The District Spike Out Hunger Tournament was held at Schor Middle School in Piscataway on February 21st! It was an extremely fun event! It was great to see all of the divisional winners battle it out and see other attendees there as well! We raised over $700 dollars and 120 pounds of food for the NJ Federation of Food Banks!

Please remember that as our service year is ending soon so end the year strong by supporting our district project!

Please let me know if you have any questions and I hope to see you at DCON!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
Josie Suddeth<br>
New Jersey District Governor<br>
