Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!

I hope you all have been having an awesome week! Whether you have been stressing with college apps, school or sports, I hope you all have felt better with each service hour you’ve earned! The N.J. District just had our huge Fall Rally and has some important events coming up soon!

Fall Rally was a big success! It was wonderful to see around 2,200 of you there ready to learn about what is going on in Key Club! All attendees attended a fun and informative session, cheered their heads off and listened attentively! Shout out to Division 8 for winning the spirit stick! I am very sad that this was my last Fall Rally. I highly encourage you all to attend Fall Rally next year!

Our District Project this year is The NJ Federation of Food Banks. The Federation works towards feeding the many food deprived people in our state. Please make sure you fill out the google form whenever you donate and record all service hours, donations and funds for the District Project correctly on the CMRF. It is extremely pertinent that you all do this so we can keep track of our district goals! As a clarification, if you give food directly to a food pantry, like if your school has a food pantry in it like mine, this still counts towards the goal and should still be recorded the same.

Spike Out Hunger volleyball divisional tournaments are coming up super soon!!!! Please attend your divisional tournaments!!! You can play volleyball, eat food, and have fun while donating to a cause that feeds struggling people! This is the definition of a win-win situation! Why would you not want to go? Please contact your LTG so you can register you and your team ahead of time. Please contact me or your LTG with any questions!

Hunger Awareness Week is also happening from November 9th-13th! Participate in the daily tasks to spread awareness about our District Project! Monday is paper sales! Print out paper cut outs and sell them for $1 each! Tuesday is $2 Tuesday! You can only spend $2 for lunch in school. Wear orange, the Student’s Change Hunger color, on Wednesday! Thursday is Informative Day! Hand out flyers out the Federation and Students Change Hunger during lunch! Friday is #FoodBankFriday –take photos and post with this hashtag to spread awareness for our district project! 

Key Leader is an amazing experience! I have been twice and have taken key different lessons out of both experiences. At Key Leader, attendees learn about leadership techniques, team building and more all while having fun! I strongly encourage you all to attend. This year Key Leader is from December 4th-6th at Camp Cross Roads in Port Murray, NJ. The cost is $200, but if you sign up before November 21st, you get $25 off! Go to http://key-leader.org/ to sign up. NJ Key Leader registration is in the left column. 

Please contact me with any questions!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>

New Jersey District Governor
