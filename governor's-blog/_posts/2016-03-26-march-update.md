Hello NJ Key Clubbers!

I hope you all are having a great day! I have my final update for you all, I hope you all enjoy!

District Convention is six days away! DCON is going to excellent this year. We have great speakers, workshops and fun activities! I am excited to see many of you there!

I got to attend NJ CKI DCON two weekends ago. It was great to celebrate their year, attend their workshops and learn how they operate. NJ CKI does so much service. Even though I won’t be attending college in NJ, I look forward to being in CKI. I hope all you seniors are planning on joining CKI whether you are attending college in NJ or not. For seniors whose colleges don’t have a CKI, remember that there is always a K-Family member ready to help you build a club.

For those not attending DCON, this is my farewell blog post to all of you. When I came into office, I wanted maintain communication with members of all branches of the K-Family, run a monthly blog on the district website to help bridge the gap between club and district, help clubs grow through aiding lieutenant governors, improve district events with new information and fun elements to increase district participation, oversee a large scale project for our new District Project, and make the New Jersey District the best of all the rest!

Thanks to your support, I have been able to do what I set out to do. I stayed in contact with a plethora of K-Family members, oversaw that everyone had access to my monthly blog posts, focused a lot of time helping LTGs, was actively involved in all event planning and sought feedback through surveys, and oversaw Spike Out Hunger volleyball tournaments.

It has been a true honor to serve you all and wherever life takes you, I hope you recall your time and memories from Key Club fondly. Never forget the joy of serving others.


Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
Josie Suddeth<br>
New Jersey District Governor<br>
