        <p>With this initiative, the New Jersey Federation of Food Banks and the New Jersey District of Key Club International have teamed up to galvanize awareness for hunger and poverty that are affecting our neighbors right here in New Jersey. You may not know it, but 1 in 8 people in New Jersey struggle with hunger - put that in the perspective of whichever school you attend, town in which you live, or activities in which you engage. Hunger is a very real problem, but often overlooked, so we are giving Key Clubbers opportunities to engage with their communities to make a difference.</p>
