<h1 class="title">Dues</h1>

Here is an explanation of the dues process for the 2014-2015 service year. During the 71st International Convention, the **cost of international dues was raised to $7.00**. District dues are still **$5.50**. Clubs are also permitted to charge an additional **$5.00** in order to nurture their club treasuries. The minimum charge for dues is no less than **$12.50** and no more than **$17.50**.

If the dues payment for your club is received by **November 1st, 2014**, the club will win an "Early Bird Award." If you are unable to have them received by the previously mentioned date, you can still send the dues payment in to meet the requirement for a dues paid club status. The deadline for regular dues payment is **December 1st, 2014**. Remember, for both of these dates, the dues payment must be received by the District, not postmarked.

As I am sure you already know, dues are vital for the smooth functioning of the District. Not only do they keep the District and International progress afloat, but they are also essential in coming back to reward members. Dues help pay for district functions like Regional Training Conferences, Fall Rally, and District Convention as well as help to fund the district website and cover the cost of printing the *Jersey Key*.

# Process for Dues Payment

1. Go to <http://www.keyclub.org/MUC/>.

2. Log into the Membership Update Center using the information provided from your advisor (see the below list for instructions on setting up a password if you do not already have one).

3. Update and edit all necessary member information (ex: deleting seniors, updating officer list).

4. Once your club member information is accurate and updated, print the invoice and either 1) mail it with a check or 2) submit credit card information directly after generating an invoice.

# How to Create a Password (Completed by an Advisor)

1. If you are new to using this system click the Register/Reset Password the first time you use the Membership Update Center.

2. Enter a faculty advisor’s email address (NOT a personal address) and further instructions to set up a password will be sent to that address – check for this email but note the response may not be immediate.

3. If an advisor or club secretary is having difficulties accessing the Membership Update Center, send an email to Member Services and be sure to include what the problem is and all pertinent information (club’s full name, your name, phone, email). Note this information must be emailed.
