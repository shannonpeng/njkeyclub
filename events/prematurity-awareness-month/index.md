<h1 class="title">Prematurity Awareness Month</h1>

Every year in the United States, more than half a million babies are born too early and classified as premature. Across the globe each year, 15 million babies are born prematurely. Babies born too soon face the risk of severe health problems, disabilities over the long term, and death. The number one cause of death in newborn babies is prematurity. To combat this increasingly global issue, March of Dimes launched the Prematurity Campaign in 2003 to help families deliver perfectly healthy babies at their full term.

November is Prematurity Awareness Month, and March of Dimes asks Key Clubbers around the nation to use this time to specifically focus on the issue of premature birth. Besides dedicating the entire month of November for raising awareness about prematurity, the New Jersey Key Club District Board asks you to make note of **World Prematurity Day on November 17th**.

Come help spread the word about the serious problem of premature birth by using the hashtag: #NJMod.
