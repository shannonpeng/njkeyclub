        <h1>What are RTCs?</h1>

        <p>Regional Training Conferences, or RTCs, are a series of training conferences organized by the NJ District Board. All members of Key Club - general members, officers, and advisors alike - are invited to join!</p>

        <p>RTCs are held from 9am to 1pm on select weekends, and they feature informative workshops on a variety of topics, including: district events, service and fundraising ideas, public speaking, and ways to get more involved with Key Club. New club officers are strongly encouraged to attend - in fact, each officer <b>MUST attend at least one RTC</b> during his/her term in order to be distinguished at the end of the year at District Convention.</p>

        <p>Each club is encouraged to send at least one representative to its nearest RTC - and keep in mind, the more the merrier!</p>

        <h1>Why should I go?</h1>

        <p>Going to an RTC can help you become more familiar with how Key Club branches from your school's club, to the NJ District level, and to Key Club International. You'll be able to get to know your 2016-2017 District Board and make friends with numerous other Key Clubbers around New Jersey through fun icebreakers.</p>

        <p>Plus, we have free food!</p>
