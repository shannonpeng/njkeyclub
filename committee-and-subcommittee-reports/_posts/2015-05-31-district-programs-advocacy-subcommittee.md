###What does the Advocacy Subcommittee do?
The Advocacy Subcommittee focuses on raising awareness about the New Jersey District’s Advocacy focus. For the 2015-2016 service year, the New Jersey District Board collaboratively decided on the Advocacy focus being Autism. In other words, during this service year all the Key Clubs around New Jersey will be advocating for those who suffer from Autism. Autism was chosen for the advocacy focus because everyone is affected one way or another by Autism. Whether it’s one’s own sibling, child, friend or even just a student in your own school, Autism affects those around us one way or another. Because of this, Key Club can work with their school’s autism program to spread this advocacy focus to those unaware of how many people are truly affected by Autism. 

###So what is advocacy? 
Advocacy is speaking on behalf of others who cannot speak for themselves. The Lieutenant Governor of Division 16, Christine Jimenez, and Lieutenant Governor of Division 7, Julia Paco, correspondingly serve as the co-chairs for this subcommittee. Together they have helped mold the District’s Advocacy focus for the 2015-2016 service year, and they are always looking for new and better ways to improve it.
