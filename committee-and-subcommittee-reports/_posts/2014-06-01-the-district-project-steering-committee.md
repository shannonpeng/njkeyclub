Salutations, Key Clubbers!

# What is this year's District Project?

This year, the New Jersey District has once again chosen the ELIMINATE Project as the District Project! The ELIMINATE Project is a global effort to eradicate maternal and neonatal tetanus, a life-threatening disease that takes the life of one baby every 9 minutes, from this world. A baby that is infected with tetanus only lives between 3 and 7 days, dying after suffering excruciating pain and sensitivity to light and touch.

# What is The Kiwanis Family doing to help?

In 2010, Kiwanis International teamed up with the ELIMINATE Project to help in the effort to rid the world of tetanus. With 25 countries remaining still afflicted with the disease, and one more year left in the ELIMINATE Project campaign, Kiwanis and Key Club International are making their best efforts to help the Project reach its goal. Each year, the District Project Steering (DPS) Committee decides on a fundraising goal for the District!

# What is this year's fundraising goal?

This year, the Committee has set a fundraising goal of: $109,325.15, representing the following:

- 10: For 2010, the year Kiwanis and the ELIMINATE Project joined forces to eradicate tetanus
- 9: For the one baby that dies of tetanus every 9 minutes.
- 3: For the series of 3 vaccinations needed to immunize a mother and her future babies.
- 25: For the 25 countries that remain affected by MNT
- 15: For 2015, the year the ELIMINATE Project campaign ends.

The DPS Committee is responsible for monitoring and encouraging fundraising all over the district, keeping track of progress being made on the fundraising goal. ELIMINATE Week is also the responsibility of DPS. The committee comes up with an activity for each day of the week, whether it be showing off the ELIMINATE spirit or raising funds for the project. All clubs are encouraged to participate in ELIMINATE Week and host as many fundraisers as possible this service year, not only to help reach the District fundraising goal but also to benefit the ELIMINATE Project to the fullest in the last year of its campaign.

Good luck and happy fundraising, New Jersey District!
