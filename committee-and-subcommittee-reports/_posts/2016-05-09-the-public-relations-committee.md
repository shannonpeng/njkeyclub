The Public Relations Committee dedicates itself to promoting the ideals of Key Club. Through the use of flyers, videos, social media profiles on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and more, the committee serves to better connect the members of the New Jersey District of Key Club International as well as consistently provide the most recent, relevant information possible.

The committee consists of two subcommittees: Publicize and Inform. The Publicize subcommittee includes District Webmaster Akshaya Dinesh, LTG Kiana Lim, and LTG Kacie Reynolds. The Inform subcommittee includes District Editor Julien Rosenbloom, LTG Sean Quinn, and LTG Colin Colchamiro.

As of April 2015, the Public Relations Committee has filmed, edited, and published the promotional video for spring Regional Training Conferences (Theme: under the neon lights). The flyer and other promotional materials are listed [here](/events/rtcs). The committee has begun work on Fall Rally Promotion, and more info will be available by August.
