K-family growth is a subcommittee of the District Programs committee. Its aim is to help other lieutenant governors charter clubs and to create a list of target schools for club chartering. As many of you know, Key Club is successful because of the hundreds of schools that have it. By making the effort to charter new clubs, we can help Key Club grow and make major changes in the world. 

Club chartering isn’t restricted to just building Key Clubs. We also aim to charter at least 1 K-Kids, 1 Builders Club, 1 Kiwanis, and 1 Circle-K before DCON 2016. We hope to achieve this by contacting the principals of schools, helping them find a club advisor, recruiting members, purchasing the club building kit, and acting as a source for chartering questions.  

Please don’t ever hesitate to ask me (Julian Maceren) at ltg11.maceren@gmail.com or Yasmine at ltg6.abed@gmail.com about any club chartering questions.
