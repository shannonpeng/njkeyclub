Just like K-Family Growth and Advocacy, K-Family Relations also branches off District Programs. This subcommittee is focused on the communication between Key Club and the Circle K and Kiwanis counterparts. The goal is to strengthen the relationships. K-Family Relations also provides event information, spreading the word of Key Club events to Circle K and Kiwanis as well as spreading their events through the NJ District of Key Club. This is to keep the flow of events for all K-Family branches spreading in the vine of service. In this subcommittee the main idea is to promote unity.

Another part of being in the K-Family Relations subcommittee is the directives. As a subcommittee we are in charge of compiling a list of all the Kiwanis groups in New Jersey and the Key Clubs they sponsor. This is to provide an accurate directory where anybody can look to find out more information and increase the communication between their club and their sponsors or vice versa. K-Family Relations also compiles a directory of all the Circle K, Builders and K-Kids Clubs in New Jersey. This directory is also used to strengthen communication where there are these clubs all in the same area. The K-Family is exactly what is states, a family and we make a bigger difference in the world together. K-Family Relations strives for all the branches to come together for service projects and events, that is our purpose.
