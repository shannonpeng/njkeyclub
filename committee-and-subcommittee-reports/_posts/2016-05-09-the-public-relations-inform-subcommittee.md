The Inform Subcommittee of the Public Relations Committee is responsible for informing the members of the New Jersey District about the happenings of the District. The Subcommittee is comprised of District Editor Julien Rosenbloom, Lieutenant Governor of Division 13 Sean Quinn, and Lieutenant Governor of Division 16 Colin Colchamiro. The Subcommittee informs members of the District using promotional videos that can be passed on to Lieutenant Governors to be used at target schools and for publicizing purposes/orientations for clubs on the District Website, as well as, brochures to help publicize Key Club as a whole. Another duty is brainstorming new and unique ways to reach out to Key Clubbers and publicize about Regional Training Conferences, Fall Rally, Key Leader and District Convention. Lastly, the Subcommittee works with the other Committees of the New Jersey District Board to help publicize their work, including promoting the District Project, District Programs, and the Advocacy Focus.
