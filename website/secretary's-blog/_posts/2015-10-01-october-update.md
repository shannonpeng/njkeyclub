Salutations, New Jersey District! 

It may be hard to believe, but we are almost halfway through the service year! There are some things you must keep in mind as the service year winds down. 

- There is still time to hand in your CMRFs! Even if some CMRFs are late (even by a few months,) your club will still be eligible for the 100% CMRF Award at DCON. 
- The deadline to send in all CMRFs for the 100% CMRF award is November 10th. (This is also, conveniently, the deadline for the October CMRF!)
- Please continue sending all CMRFs, including all the ones you may have missed, to njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com. This email will also be in effect for the next service year and moving forward, so please continue to send CMRFs there. 
- If you have not already done so, make a folder- either physical or electronic- containing just your CMRFs. This will come in handy when filling out the Annual Achievement Report Form (AARF). Remember, you MUST submit the AARF to qualify for any contests at District Convention. 
	- A physical copy of the AARF will be in the December District Mailing and an electronic version will be sent by then as well. 
- Work with your president, advisor, and club treasurer to make sure all records from fundraising and service projects are accurate. Again, this will make filling out the AARF much easier! 

As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
Farwa Shakeel
