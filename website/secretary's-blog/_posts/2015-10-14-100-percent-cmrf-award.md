Hello, NJ District! 

It is bittersweet to say that we are almost halfway through the service year. However, with the end of the service year brings District Convention, or DCON. DCON is a great chance to earn awards like the 100% CMRF Award. Throughout the service year, you have been working hard to compile the Club Monthly Report Form (or CMRF) for each month. The 100% CMRF Award allows clubs to be rewarded for their hard work and dedication in filling out CMRFs. Here are the basic rules: 

- ALL CMRFs from the service year must have been submitted. If you have been sending your CMRFs on a monthly basis, there is no need to send all of them in once again. 

- If you are missing any CMRFs, you can hand them in late and STILL be eligible for the 100% CMRF Award. For example, if you did not hand in your July CMRF, you may still send it in and be eligible for the 100% CMRF Award. 

- If you would like to make sure of what CMRFs you have sent in, please contact either District Secretary Farwa Shakeel at [njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com](mailto:njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com) and/or myself. 

- All CMRFs for the service year must be sent in by November 10th, including the October CMRF which is due on the same day. 

- Please send any missing CMRFs to [njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com](mailto:njkeyclubcmrf@gmail.com).

Overall, the 100% CMRF Award is very easy to earn. If you have any questions, please contact myself or Secretary Farwa at [secretary.shakeel@gmail.com](mailto:secretary.shakeel@gmail.com).
