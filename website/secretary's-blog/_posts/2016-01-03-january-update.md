Salutations, New Jersey District Secretaries!

These next few months are an exciting time, but they move quickly. In these next few months, your clubs will likely be busy planning for District Convention, putting together last minute service projects, and supporting potential candidates for the positions of Lieutenant Governor or an Executive position. 

As a secretary, your role in successfully completing the service year will be vital. Here are some things to keep in mind: 

- The AARF has been released and can be found in the December District Mailing. Completion of the AARF is required in order to receive any formal recognition at both District and International Convention. If you have been filling out your CMRFs every month, completing the AARF will be much easier. Make sure you work with your club presidents and advisors to ensure the AARF is accurate. 
- Keep a timeline to track entries for any District Convention contests. A Google Sheets Document will be helpful for this. Create a document with the names of the contests your club wishes to enter and the date it is due. (You may also want to include the deadline for the AARF.) Use one color to indicate that the contest has been completed and submitted (if it is a prejudged contest) and another to indicate the contest has been completed (if it is an at-DCON contest.) 
- Continue filling out CMRFs on a monthly basis. 
- Apply for a scholarship, and ensure that the scholarship packet is available to all officers and members that may wish to apply. 

Please contact me with any questions or concerns! 

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
