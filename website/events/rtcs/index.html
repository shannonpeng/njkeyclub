        <h1>What are Regional Training Conferences?</h1>

        <p>Regional Training Conferences, commonly known as RTCs, are biannual training conferences for all Key Clubbers to attend. General members, officers, and advisors alike are invited to come and get the inside scoop on district events, service and fundraising ideas, and other ways to get involved in Key Club.</p>

        <p>New Key Club officers are especially encouraged to come. There will be many useful training workshops for new officers that will help them accomplish their goals and duties during the service year. In fact, each officer <b>MUST attend at least one RTC</b> during his/her term in order to be distinguished at the end of the year.</p>

        <p>Each club is encouraged to send at least one representative to RTCs. If your clubs send more, it will be able to split its resources and cover more ground.</p>
