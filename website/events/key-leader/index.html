    <p>Imagine a weekend in the woods with about 65 Key Clubbers learning about service, leadership, and having fun while doing it – that is exactly what Key Leader is! This year, from <b>December 4th - December 6th</b>, Kiwanis is sponsoring their annual Key Leader in <b>Camp Cross Roads</b> in <b>Port Murray, NJ</b>! As mentioned, about 65 students join together for a weekend to learn about what it means to be a leader.  From ropes courses to informative workshops, Key Leader is an overall amazing experience! At Key Leader you are able to meet teens from all over New Jersey who share a passion for service just like you! The friendships and bonds you form at Key Leader are incredible. The great thing is that not just Key Clubbers attend – students not in Key Club as well as 8th Graders can join in on the fun!</p>

    <p>If a student has attended a Key Leader prior to this year, they are able to sign up as a Student Facilitator. At Key Leader, students break off into groups called “neighborhoods” and Student Facilitators are in charge of neighborhoods.  The neighborhood will have to create their own mascots, posters, and will be taking part in team building activities together. The Student Facilitators will get a discounted price of about $115 of what would be $200 for non Key Clubbers and $175 for Key Clubbers. The money goes towards food, lodging and activities throughout the weekend. It is truly a life changing experience, and you get to meet so many amazing people!</p>
