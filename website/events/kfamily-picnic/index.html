    <p>As an annual event, each summer, the NJ District of Circle K holds an event for all branches of the K-Family called the K-Family Picnic. At this event, you spend the day with fellow Key Clubbers as well as the K-Kids (elementary level), Builders Clubs (middle school level), Circle K (college level), and Kiwanis. You can engage in community service, food, fun and games right on the beach!</p>

    <p>This event serves as a great way to mingle and get to know your fellow K-Family members. United, the K-Family can fight for any cause and change the world, so this event also allows you to build relationships with fellow volunteers to work together in the future. The more people involved in making a change the bigger the change is! Utilizing the bonds you make at this picnic may allow for your events to reach a wider audience. Join us for a fun day on the beach!</p> 

	<p>This event will be taking place <b>July 19th from 10:30am to 4:00pm</b> rain or shine at <b>100 Green Island Road Toms River, NJ 08573</b>. Feel free to contact Division 22 LTG <b><a href="/board/ciara.html">Ciara Clarkin</a></b> at <b><a href="mailto:ltg22.clarkin@gmail.com">ltg22.clarkin@gmail.com</a></b> with any questions.</p>
