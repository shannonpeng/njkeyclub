My name is Bobbie Boettinger and I am pleased to introduce myself as the 2015-2016 District Treasurer. I am currently a sophomore at West Essex High School. As a freshman I was a general member when I began high school. From there I became the Lieutenant Governor of Division 19. In
middle school I was a part of the Builder’s Club and in seventh grade I was the vice president. I am extremely excited to be on the district board once
again!

Not only am I a part of Key Club, but I also sing in my school’s choir, and
play volleyball. I always have loved music and just like Key Club my passion
and love for it grows stronger as each day goes by. Anything that I am
involved in, I put all of my passion, dedication, and hard work into it. Being
involved artistically, athletically, and academically in my school has helped
me grow as both a person and a leader. I cannot wait to put my leadership
skills to work as District Treasurer for our upcoming service year. I am a
team player that loves to help anyone as much as I can. I am a very
personable, so feel free to talk to me at any time throughout the year.
As District Treasurer I have goals I want to accomplish for this upcoming
year. Some of my goals are:

- Have all dues paid by December 1st
- Build more communication between the clubs and the district
- Raise more money than we have in past years

I cannot wait for the new service year to begin. I am very excited to meet
and work with you all. If you ever have any questions, concerns, or ideas
feel free to call, text, or email me. You can also find me on social media and
reach me through there!
