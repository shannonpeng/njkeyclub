I'm Sarah Park and I'm so lucky and honored to serve as your New Jersey District Secretary for the 2015-2016 year. My love of Key Club began freshman year in my home club, Millburn. I walked into the first meeting feeling lost among the over one-hundred members, but everyone was quick to accept me into the family and I knew I found a place to call home. Since then, I've gone from a General Member, to Committee Head, to co-Webmaster with the amazing District Webmaster Shannon Peng. By forcing me to really think about others, Key Club has made me a more empathetic person. I am so thankful for my experiences with Key Club because they have given me a means to effect real, meaningful change. I want to help expand the influence of our organization to help others discover the power of service.

On the weekends I'm not at board meetings, district events or RTCs, you can most likely find me
debating at a high school or college somewhere across the country. I'm an avid Public Forum debater and I hope to use my communication and critical thinking skills to improve our board and district. In addition, I've been playing violin since I was six years old and I adore music â€” everything from Vampire Weekend to Shostakovich. I'm also my class president and I hope to use my experience leading committees and putting on fundraisers to help our district reach new heights.

Key Club is the most important thing I've been lucky enough to be a part of. I will serve with
passion and dedication in upholding my duties throughout the year. If you attended DCON you are
well aware that I hope to spark change in this service district. In addition to completing my duties, I hope to:

- Digitize all forms to make the switch from word to PDF forms so I can use programs to increase our district's organization and efficiency
- Reach out more directly to secretaries through text updates, emails, and social media to increase CMRF collection as well as integration within our district
- Maintain additional organizational resources to ensure all necessary information is received by the board in a timely fashion (i.e. spreadsheet of life 2.0)
- Improve communication between the board and clubs by working with PR to try to get every Key
Clubber in New Jersey to stay updated on district activity and events

Please feel free to email me or facebook message me with any questions, concerns, or just to say hi. I know the paperwork can be tedious so I want to help you in any way possible. Secretaries, especially, I'd like you to tell me your complaints. I want to make this year as enjoyable and productive as possible, but I can't make changes unless I know what problems you are having. Especially because I was a club webmaster, I don't know the full extent of secretary struggles; so, at any time throughout the year if you feel that something about your role is laborious or unnecessary, I want to know so that I can be proactive and make the necessary changes. I wish you the very best with everything this service year. This year is
going to be incredible.
