Hi! My name is Iskander Turan and it is my honor to be serving you as your Lieutenant Governor for the service year of 2015-2016 for Division 17! I am currently a Junior at Tenafly High School and have been involved in Key Club for the past three years. However, it was not long ago that I truly found my passion and joy in Key Club and that is something I wish to help spread throughout our division.

I was born in the UK and lived there for the first thirteen years of my life. I like to think I have a combination of both English and American culture and I hope to share that with you! Among many things I have gained, Key Club has most importantly taught me the true meaning of service and helping others in my community. This ultimately inspired me to run for the Lieutenant Governor position because it allowed me to actively take role in an international organization which would directly influence the lives of my community and of the world! I am so grateful to have the opportunity to meet wonderful fellow high-school students who share the same interests and hobbies that I do and I cannot wait to meet you all!
As your Lieutenant Governor, I will be essentially providing as a liaison between the club-level and the district-level. I look forward to making the next year as amazing as my prior years at Key Club have proven to me. Unlike common belief, Key Club is not a club that builds keys or a great way to look impressive on your college application. It is rather a great way to find more about yourself while additionally serving your community and interacting with others.

As an identical twin, I have always been ambitious and a tad competitive. Thus, this year, I have several goals that I know we can tackle together this upcoming service year:

- To have an unprecedented number of Key Clubbers attend DCON, RTCs, Fall Rally and Key Leader
- To train all my officers and visit as many clubs as possible
- To further increase the communications between the clubs
- To hold several divisional events
- To charter at least one Builderâ€™s Club/K-Kids Club
- To strengthen a Kiwanis Club in my division

Although Key Club does preoccupy a large portion of my life, I do have other interests and hobbies! Namely, I enjoy playing soccer and I am a huge supporter of Chelsea Football Club. I actively participate in my Chemistry Club where I research and take part in competitions. I also love learning the French language and have founded my High School French Cultural Club. This is just a glimpse of my personality but I am impatient to get to know you all as soon as possible and to embark on one of the most distinct years of our lives.
