My name is Yasmine Abed and it is an honor to say that I will be serving as the Division 6 Lieutenant Governor of the New Jersey District of Key Club International for the 2015-2016 service year.

To start off, I would like to tell you a little bit about myself. I am currently a junior at Steinert High School, located in Hamilton, NJ. I joined Key Club my freshman year and have enjoyed every bit of it; since joining, I've met amazing people and improved my leadership skills. I've held several positions in my home club; freshman year I was a class officer, sophomore year vice president, and junior year I was president before being elected as LTG. Over the past three years, I've truly found a passion for volunteering and realized how much of an impact it makes in the school and community.

In addition to Key Club, I am involved with Science Club, Peer Leadership, Production and Stage Crew of my school's play, and the Student Government Association (SGA). In SGA I aheld the position of Corresponding Secretary and next school year will be the President. I'm also a member of the Latin National Honor Society and look forward to being inducted to the Science National Honor Society this May. Outside of school and Key Club, I enjoy traveling and spending time with my friends and family.

I am beyond excited to kick off this service year and I would like to share my goals for the division with you:

- Have all dues paid on time
- Have clubs participate in District events such as Fall Rally and DCON
- Improve communication and connections between clubs within Division 6
- Train all officers by Fall Rally and making sure they fulfill all duties throughout the year
- Building a new K-Family club in the district

My main focus is you, the clubs of my division. Your goals are my goals so please never hesitate to contact me with any questions, concerns, and/or new ideas! I'm always open to new suggestions and I have no doubt that if we all work together this upcomign service year, then we can accomplish great things. If you ever need to contact me, I am easily reachable on Facebook, my phone - through text and/or call (609)-947-7657, and I will always readily answer any emails (ltg6.abed@gmail.com)! I look forward to meeting you all very soon!
