My name is Samantha Levisay from Phillipsburg High School Key Club, and it is a pleasure to introduce myself as the New Jersey District Governor for the 2014-2015 service year.

Joining Key Club as a freshman I joined with the thoughts of filling up my college application, but I stayed for the service. Key Club is a phenomenal organization that has evolved me from a fervent follower to a bubbly, passionate leader. The most remarkable aspect of Key Club is that it truly is student led. Being a part of this organization has introduced opportunities to me as well as the student leaders of the world.

During my freshman year I served my club as a general member and achieved Golden Member. In my sophomore year I was my clubâ€™s editor and achieved distinguished club editor. Then, this past NJ District Convention I was honored to be named a Robert F. Lucas Lieutenant Governor award recipient. Serving as International Programs chair and DCON Theme chair I am confident that I have the experience and drive to lead this District with full attentiveness and skill.

Serving on the New Jersey District Board is a time consuming job. From writing *Jersey Key* articles to collecting dues there is always a job to be done and a duty to be fulfilled. Joining this board, every member knew of the seriousness and dedication they must have yet I have not met a single board member who regrets becoming a part of this family. I want to keep their enthusiasm and excitement peaked throughout the year while also achieving my goals.

My main goals of this year are:

- To Improve District events and materials taught to officers
- Improve communication with the district board, clubs, and the K-Family
- Build clubs throughout the K-Family of New Jersey
- Make New Jersey the best District in Key Club International

My goals seem simple but they are the foundations to strengthening New Jersey Key Clubs and allowing for the members to foster a love for service and leadership. I have many ideas in store for this year, and I plan to lead this district with devotion. This service year, I hope to become not only a friend to my board but also a leader. I look forward to working with you to serve not only Key Clubs but the world.
