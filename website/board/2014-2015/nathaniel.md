My name is Nathaniel Silberman, and I can say with distinct pleasure that it will be an honor to serve as the Lieutenant Governor for Division 13 during the 2014-2015 service year. As a current junior at Voorhees High School, I can look back at the beginning of my service with Key Club in high school and see why I came to be Lieutenant Governor today. I started as a general member in my freshman year, and then later served as the Vice President of my school during my sophomore year. After attending numerous club and local Kiwanis meetings, DCM’s, Key Leader, RTC’s, and DCON, I can honestly say that Key Club has shaped my life and changed me for the better.

I am excited to start off my term, and cannot wait to help make our division great. I have several goals that I wish to accomplish during my time as Lieutenant Governor, which include:

- Lead our Division to become a more cohesive group
- Host at least 2 divisional events
- Create a divisional service project
- Strengthen the connection each club has with itself and the community
- Increase the number of attending members for each club
- Train all of the Division 13 Officers by Fall Rally
- Visit each school club several times throughout the service year
- Have at least one club win an award for service at District Convention
- Have all dues paid early
- Increase the number of Builder’s Clubs

I cannot wait to begin this service year and make it the best our division has ever had! I am privileged to represent Division 13 as Lieutenant Governor and for the opportunity to lead it during the 2014-2015 service year. I hope to accomplish and surpass all of my goals, and cannot wait to work with all of my fellow officers.
