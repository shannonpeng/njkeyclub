My name is **Dianna Torres**, and I am honored to have the opportunity to identify myself as **Lieutenant Governor for Division 2** and serve under the 2014-2015-service year district board. This service year will be our first year as Division 2, and I hope to help serve you all in a way that will help our division grow to be beyond amazing! Division 2 is comprised of **Cedar Creek High School**, **Egg Harbor Twp. High School**, **Atlantic County Institute of Technology**, **Absegami High School**, and **Pleasantville High School**. Currently, I am a junior at Cedar Creek High School; I began Key Club as a sophomore, and was a general member for only a few months before I had to step up to the position to be my clubs secretary. It was then, when I was elected secretary, that I found a true passion for Key Club. After experiencing some major Key Club events, and seeing the love and passion many other high school students from all over New Jersey had, I knew I wanted to become more, so I decided to run for Lieutenant Governor.

Although I attend Cedar Creek High School, I live in Mays Landing, and I am enrolled in the engineering magnet program. I am an Honors student at Cedar Creek, and in the Spanish Honor Society, as well as invited to be in the National Honor Society. I am also an active member of my schools Math club, but nothing beats out the time and dedication I have spent in Key Club, and making caring my way of life. Outside of school, I am also a student at Amerikick Karate, in Egg Harbor Twp. I have been a student there for almost 4 years, and am currently a brown belt.

I am so enthusiastic to begin the service year, and work with you all. Here is a list of my goals for the year:

- To train 100% of the officers
- Help clubs create strong relationships with each other
- Strengthen relationships between clubs and school administration
- Hold at least 2 divisional projects and 1 interdivisional event
- Establish other Key clubs to expand our Division and build a Kiwanis Club
- Increase our divisional District Convention attendance
- Make sure all dues are paid on time
- Become a Robert F. Lucas Lieutenant Governor

Although, I may be your Lieutenant Governor, please keep in mind that one must serve before they lead, and a good leader always walks with the people, therefore, I am eager to hear your ideas and vision for this division for this service year. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me!
