Greetings, my name is Brooke Willemstyn, and I am honored to write this letter of introduction as your lieutenant governor of division 10 for the 2014-2015 service year. I have worked as treasurer, acting secretary, and president of my home club, Red Bank Regional, giving me a solid platform of knowledge for training club officers at upcoming Regional Training Conferences, and will keep up to date as to whether or not they are performing their respective duties. I originate from division 9, but could not be more excited to be brought into this new division. I encourage and will assist division 10’s magnificent key clubs to work with, and grow together as a division this service year.

Throughout my entire life, service has always appealed to me on a level more than self-gain. While it is nice to receive a pat on the back for a job well-done, it is much more gratifying to see the impact in the eyes of those who’s lives we Key Clubbers have the ability to impact, and often, improve upon. It would be a selfish endeavor to keep this joy of service to myself, and so throughout this term I will be focusing on growth of my existing clubs, and the chartering of new local clubs, with the help of the K-Family. To do so, I have determined the following goals, to be gradually completed throughout my term:

- Visit all existing clubs and contact prospective schools (clubs to be chartered) by the end of the 2014 school year.
- Have the majority of officers trained by or shortly after Fall Rally, at a regional training conference (RTC), and by offering conveniently placed and timed officer training conferences (OTC).
- Increase attendance at district events such as District Convention (DCON; the annual weekend conference held at Ocean Place in Long Branch where awards are distributed, workshops held, and lots of fun had by the entire NJ District) and Fall Rally (gathering at Six Flags Great Adventure) by publicizing the events and providing opportunities to fundraise to participate (including chocolate sales, fundraising ideas presentation or powerpoint, etc.).
- Introduce service projects for clubs to take over and prepare them to be competitors for big service awards (as well as all other awards) at DCON 2015; such include the Yuda Bands project.
- Let the goals of the NJ District reflect the needs of division 10.
