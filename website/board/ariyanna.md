Hello my fellow Key Club members of the New Jersey District my name is Ariyanna Santiago, and I am very enthusiastic to introduce myself as Lieutenant Governor of division 3 for this new service year. I am currently a junior attending Millville Senior High School and I have been in Key Club for two years. I excited to say this division has improved greatly and together I hope we can continue to make improvements. I am looking forward to a productive service year. Starting off as a general member I later became project organizer in my home club. In school I have also participated in other various activities that have shaped me into a leader. I am in National Honor Society and participate in Mock Trial and Model Congress.

Service has always played a major role in my life, from being a peer mediator, volunteering hundreds of hours in middle and high school and so much more. Key Club has allowed me to be an active person in my community and meet new people. I have been able to touch the lives of children and see them enjoy themselves in a safe environment. Members in my club have quickly become a second family to me. Being a part of this amazing organization as made me come out of my shell which is one of the reasons I would love to give back by continuing to lead this division to the best of my capabilities and beyond. My plan is to lead and inspire others to do good in this world. 

In order to improve and maintain my division I plan toâ€¦

- Expand the K-Family
- Link the division together
- Increase activity and attendance to DECON and Fall Rally
- Together create massive projects as a division 
- Excite others to join by advertising 
- Smarter communication
- Have dues paid by December
- Have officers trained by mid-October
- Attempt to fix/  decrease issues with drop of participation after Fall Rally
- Create new projects and events.

I hope this upcoming service is exceptionally memorable and we create new milestones. Please feel free to contact me I am available by email, Facebook, and phone. I am also in the process of making a website for our division. I will get back to you as quickly and efficiently as I can. I look forward to working with all of you in the near future. My door is always open feel free to notify me with an concerns, suggestions, or questions.
