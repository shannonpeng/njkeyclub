My name is Madison Kennelly and I am your Lieutenant Governor of Division 4. I attend Gloucester County Institute of Technology and I have been a general member and treasurer at my club. Currently I am a junior in high school and attend the dance program. Dancing has been a part of my life for 15 years and GCIT gave me the opportunity to continue my training in an educational setting.

Ever since I was a little girl I have had a passion for community service. When I was four years old my sister was in a Girl Scout troop and I was so inspired by her passsion for helping others. I asked my mom if I could be in a Girl Scout troop, and since then, service has been a love of mine. My passion for service has grown immensely and so has my understanding of Key Club International.

I became a general member of Key Club International in sophomore year of high school. From the first day of club, I knew this was a place where I belonged. Key Club International welcomes any one with open arms. In the end of my first year of being a member, I ran for Treasurer and won. This was the beginning of my amazing adventure. This year of being Treasurer has opened my eyes to the world of Key Club International. Running for Lieutenant Governor may have been stressful but I would never regret making the decision to further my leadership skills. Especially when it comes to what an amazing organization Key Club international
is.

Being your Lieutenant Governor of Division 4, I have many plans and goals to spurt the growth of one of the weakest divisions in the New Jersey District. Starting with my school club, I plan to get all dues in on time by showing the consequences if we don’t pay them. Also, almost everyone on in my club does not and did not know what DCON, ICON, or Fall Rally is. My plan to inform all my clubs is by making newsletters and posters, and sending them out to every club’s officers and advisors. Along with informing my clubs, I want to help my officers understand their true duties and make sure they have a full understanding of what they should be doing. I hope in my year of service being Lieutenant Governor of Division 4, I can motivate and empower all of my general members, officers and advisors to work harder and support all of the K-Family. Goals to be met by end of my service year:

- Get all dues in on time by December 1st
- Inspire my Division
- Inform my Division about all Divisional Events more

I promise you I will surpass my goals for this year, and I will make Division 4 the strongest it can be by then end of my service year.
