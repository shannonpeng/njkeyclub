<h2>Preferred Charities</h2>

<p>Key Club International has three preferred charities. We work with these charities to raise awareness and fundraising about various issues that are plaguing our world today. The three charities are:</p>

<img src="/img/about/service-partners/about_sp_cmh.png" alt="Children's Miracle Network Hospitals (CMN Hospitals)">

<!--<p>A nonprofit organization that raises money to benefit hospitalized kids while increasing awareness of its member hospitals. All CMN Hospitals contributions directly benefit hospitals, helping to purchase up-to-date equipment, train staff, conduct life-saving research, implement outreach programs and provide health care for children whose parents can’t afford to pay.</p>

<p>At CMN Hospitals, infants and children are provided with special pharmaceuticals and equipment engineered to work with their small stature. From the tiniest tube or milliliter of medication to ECMO, a formidable device that acts as an artificial lung outside the body, medicines and machines that help sick kids get well are specialized - and high priced. Skilled pediatric professionals armed with evolving treatments and expensive tools work to save more than 14 million children annually from life-threatening injuries, birth defects, cancer, and numerous other ailments. CMN Hospitals make these and other life-saving treatments available to children regardless of a family’s ability to pay.</p>-->

<p><b>Children's Miracle Network</b> is a nonprofit organization that raises funds to aid hospitalized children across the globe. Money raised for and by the organization is dispersed to affiliate Hospitals affiliated with Children’s Miracle Network, the purchasing of up-to-date equipment, the implementation of outreach programs, and medical research, and community awareness of children’s health issues. Like a miracle, CMN provides health care for children whose parents cannot afford to pay for medical care.</p>

<img src="/img/about/service-partners/about_sp_mod.png" alt="March of Dimes">

<!--p>The mission of the March of Dimes is to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects, premature birth, and infant mortality. March of Dimes was founded by our 32nd President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the fight against polio. After the discovery of the polio vaccine, March of Dimes focused their efforts to improve the health of babies and has been successful with the help and enthusiasm of many grassroots volunteers.</p>

<p>Since 1978, Key Clubs have hosted fundraising and awareness programs to support the March of Dimes, raising over $116,000 through fundraisers in 2011 alone! Key Club members can support the March of Dimes each semester: in the fall, raise awareness by hosting programs throughout November for Prematurity Awareness Month and in the spring, raise funds by participating in March for Babies, the March of Dimes largest annual fundraiser.</p>-->

<p>The <b>March of Dimes</b> foundation works tirelessly to improve the health of premature babies. Funds donated to the foundation go towards birth defect prevention research. According the CDC, an estimated 120,000 infants in the U.S are born with major structural birth defects each year. Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and 70% of the cause of these birth defects are unknown. The funds raised by the March of Dimes Foundation funds research projects to treat and even prevent premature birth defects. The foundation was founded by the 32nd US President, Franklin D. Roosevelt in his fight ahainst polio. After successfully discovering a vaccine for polio, March of Dimes migrated their focus on premature birth research and awareness. Key Club Members can support the March of Dimes Foundation by raising premature birth awareness by hosting a multitude of programs through November for Prematurity Awareness Month, participating in the March for Babies in the spring, even simply wearing purple (Premature Awareness Color).</p>

<img src="/img/about/service-partners/about_sp_uni.png" alt="UNICEF">

<!--<p>The only organization of the United Nations dedicated exclusively to children works with other United Nations bodies, governments and non-governmental organizations to assist in children’s needs through community-based services in primary health care, basic education, and safe water and sanitation in more than 150 developing countries.</p>

<p>UNICEF shares the Kiwanis family’s global commitment to children and provided its extensive resources and leadership to assist in the Worldwide Service Project to virtually eliminate Iodine Deficiency Disorder (IDD) from the globe in the late 1990’s and is now working with Kiwanis toward eliminating Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus from the face of the planet.</p>

<p>Since 1994, Key Club has been Trick-or-Treating for UNICEF and over the years has raised nearly $5 million for iodine deficiency programs worldwide and HIV and AIDS programs in Kenya and Swaziland. Our current goal is to raise $110 million for the Eliminate Project by 2015.</p>-->

<p>For 5 years, the New Jersey District of Key Club International has partnered with <b>UNICEF</b> (United Nations Children’s Fund) for the Eliminate Project in their fight against Maternal Neonatal Tetanus, a disease that claims the lives of dozens of mothers and their infants every second of every day. As a result of the generosity of K-Families all over the globe, the Eliminate Project has eliminated this deadly virus from 36 countries. For only $1.80 one vaccine can end the pain and suffering from a mother and all of her future children. Recently one more nation has won the fight against MNT! Mauritania.</p>
