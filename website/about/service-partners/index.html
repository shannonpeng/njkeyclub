<h2>Preferred Charities</h2>

<p>Key Club International has three preferred charities. We work with these charities to raise awareness and fundraising about various issues that are plaguing our world today. The three charities are:</p>

<img src="/img/about/service-partners/about_sp_cmh.png" alt="Children's Miracle Network Hospitals (CMN Hospitals)">

<p>A nonprofit organization that raises money to benefit hospitalized kids while increasing awareness of its member hospitals. All CMN Hospitals contributions directly benefit hospitals, helping to purchase up-to-date equipment, train staff, conduct life-saving research, implement outreach programs and provide health care for children whose parents can’t afford to pay.</p>

<p>At CMN Hospitals, infants and children are provided with special pharmaceuticals and equipment engineered to work with their small stature. From the tiniest tube or milliliter of medication to ECMO, a formidable device that acts as an artificial lung outside the body, medicines and machines that help sick kids get well are specialized - and high priced. Skilled pediatric professionals armed with evolving treatments and expensive tools work to save more than 14 million children annually from life-threatening injuries, birth defects, cancer, and numerous other ailments. CMN Hospitals make these and other life-saving treatments available to children regardless of a family’s ability to pay.</p>

<img src="/img/about/service-partners/about_sp_mod.png" alt="March of Dimes">

<p>The mission of the March of Dimes is to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects, premature birth, and infant mortality. March of Dimes was founded by our 32nd President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, in the fight against polio. After the discovery of the polio vaccine, March of Dimes focused their efforts to improve the health of babies and has been successful with the help and enthusiasm of many grassroots volunteers.</p>

<p>Since 1978, Key Clubs have hosted fundraising and awareness programs to support the March of Dimes, raising over $116,000 through fundraisers in 2011 alone! Key Club members can support the March of Dimes each semester: in the fall, raise awareness by hosting programs throughout November for Prematurity Awareness Month and in the spring, raise funds by participating in March for Babies, the March of Dimes largest annual fundraiser.</p>

<img src="/img/about/service-partners/about_sp_uni.png" alt="UNICEF">

<p>The only organization of the United Nations dedicated exclusively to children works with other United Nations bodies, governments and non-governmental organizations to assist in children’s needs through community-based services in primary health care, basic education, and safe water and sanitation in more than 150 developing countries.</p>

<p>UNICEF shares the Kiwanis family’s global commitment to children and provided its extensive resources and leadership to assist in the Worldwide Service Project to virtually eliminate Iodine Deficiency Disorder (IDD) from the globe in the late 1990’s and is now working with Kiwanis toward eliminating Maternal and Neonatal Tetanus from the face of the planet.</p>

<p>Since 1994, Key Club has been Trick-or-Treating for UNICEF and over the years has raised nearly $5 million for iodine deficiency programs worldwide and HIV and AIDS programs in Kenya and Swaziland. Our current goal is to raise $110 million for the Eliminate Project by 2015.</p>
