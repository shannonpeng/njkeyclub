<blockquote><b>Advocacy<b> <i>(advəkəsē),</i> n.- to speak on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves. 
</blockquote>

<p>Every year, the New Jersey District selects an Advocacy Focus regarding an issue within our community.  This 2015-2016 Service Year, our district plans to do exactly that by advocating for those who suffer from autism.  Our state has the highest rate of autism in the Union, with 1 out of 45 children born in New Jersey being affected with the disorder.  Without support from organizations such as Key Club, many families are virtually helpless.  We can- and will- change that by providing a voice for those who must deal with this disorder every day of their lives.</p>

<p>In order to make a change in our community as a whole, we must work to raise awareness of how serious a problem autism is within New Jersey.  To do this successfully, we plan to partner with some of the organizations from within the state and across the country to create the greatest amount of change possible, and provide the most opportunities for the clubs of our district to support the cause.</p>

<p>The New Jersey District has already officially partnered with Ms. Beth Callahan, a public advocate for autism awareness.  She proposed that our District should participate in the upcoming Go the Distance for Autism Bike Ride on May 31st, a community fundraiser for four educational and treatment programs for kids and adults with autism across the state.  This will be just one of many district events that can make change for the sufferers of this disorder, and one that we need the help of every school in our district to attend.</p>
