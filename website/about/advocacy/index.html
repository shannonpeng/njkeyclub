<h1 class="title">Advocacy</h1>

<blockquote>Advocacy is speaking on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves.</blockquote>

<p>According to Key Club International, Advocacy is “speaking on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves”. To advocate for a cause is different from fundraising for it. When you fundraise, you do it and you’re done. Yes people benefited from your services, but you never let those people know what you were volunteering for! For example, if you were to build a playground for an orphanage, or for your town, the people benefit, but no one outside of your club learns about the organization you’re helping. When you advocate, you raise awareness. You try to get as many people as you can aware of the organization or problem that you are fighting for!</p>

<p>Every year, the New Jersey District Board picks a focus for the District to advocate for.</p>

<p>For the 2014-2015 service year, the New Jersey District Board has chosen hunger in the United States as its advocacy focus. This campaign aims to conduct service projects rather than fundraising. Through hands-on projects and advocacy, the campaign strives to make a difference in the district on the topic of hunger.</p>

<p>The District Board will be advocating for service organizations such as Students Change Hunger!</p>
