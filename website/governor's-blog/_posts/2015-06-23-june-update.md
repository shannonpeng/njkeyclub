Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!

I hope this post finds you in good spirits - ICON has begun! I am writing this post on the bus on the way to Indy. Today we went to Hershey’s Chocolate World and Magic Mountain in Columbus, Ohio. Tomorrow we will leave Columbus, Ohio and head to the actual convention. We will go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, participate in activities with the entire K-Family, elect the International Board, and more! With the election of the new International Board, we will get a new trustee in mid-July - keep on the lookout for ICON updates!

The K-Family Picnic is an annual event hosted by Circle K. There will be a service project, volleyball, and many other summer activities! It is July 19th from 10:30am-4pm at 100 Green Island Road Toms River, NJ 08573. There is a Facebook event page so just check that you are attending. It is going to be a lot of fun and I strongly recommend that you and your clubs attend!
Summer is upon us and I hope you all have exciting plans for the summer - summer is very different since it’s harder to meet with everyone, but there are certain activities that are always best during the summer: some ideas are lemonade stands, beach clean ups, gardens, and summer games.
Thank you so much for reading this, and please don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions.

Yours in Caring and Service,

Josie Suddeth

2015-2016 New Jersey District Governor
