Hello New Jersey District Key Clubbers!
 
My name is Kacie Hines, and I am your International Trustee for the 2015-2016 year. Along with New Jersey, I will be serving the Wisconsin- Upper Michigan and Kentucky-Tennessee Districts. I am an upcoming senior at Vestavia Hills High School in Alabama, and I’m ecstatic to see what great joy and love for service the New Jersey District has.
 
A little bit about me and my Key Club story: I joined Key Club my freshman year, and I’ve loved every minute since. My favorite service project is going to my local Boy’s Ranch around the holidays with gifts. My favorite thing about Key Club is the fact I get to meet people from around the world who have the same passion to serve as I do.
 
As a trustee, I am a liaison between the districts I serve and the International Board. I will be working primarily with the New Jersey District Board but am always open to help anything you may need! To get more connected with all members of New Jersey, I will be periodically posting blogs and keeping you up to date on International.
 
Speaking of International, next year International Convention will be in Atlanta, Georgia just a few short hours from me. It’s going to be an extraordinary weekend filled with workshops, dances, and keynote speakers. If you want to learn even more about Key Club, improve your leadership skills, or even just to meet new people who share your same passion, International Convention is the place for you!

From the bottom of my big, southern heart, I hope you have a successful and impactful year as you continue making a difference in your homes, schools, and communities!
 
Yours in service,<br>
Kacie Hines<br>
International Trustee<br>
