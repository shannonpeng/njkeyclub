Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!

I hope you all are well!

DCON is rapidly approaching, no matter how much I hate to say it. DCON this year is going to be a truly remarkable event. DCON 2016 will be from April 1st-3rd at the Ocean Place Resort and Spa in Long Branch. DCON is the celebration of an outstanding year of service and the kickoff to an even greater one. This year’s theme is License to Serve (Mission Impossible/ James Bond). There are a lot of exciting plans we have to incorporate the theme. Use your club’s two votes in the district executive officer elections! Scream for the spirit stick! Have fun at dances! Be inspired by our keynote speaker! Make connections with other service oriented individuals! Attend interactive workshops! All information about DCON is on njkeyclub.org. Read more below about other unique aspects of our convention!!!

In order to sign up for this fantabulous event, you have to register. The regular registration deadline is March 12th. But wait! If your registration is postmarked by February 12th, it is $5 less per person. If cost is a concern, I recommend having fundraisers to offset the cost or talk to your Kiwanis Club!

Another unique aspect of DCON is the opportunity to enter contests. I <span style="text-decoration:underline;font-weight:bold">highly</span> encourage you all to enter contest!!! All contests winners are announced at DCON. The contests packet was sent to all clubs in the December Mailing. Some contests are due prior to convention so be sure to pay attention to the deadlines. Your club has done so much this year; why not fill out an application and inspire other clubs to change lives?

The District Spike Out Hunger Tournament is also soon! It will be at Schor Middle School in Piscataway on February 21st. Registration will begin at 12:45 and the first match will start at 1:15. Come see the winners of the divisional tournaments battle it out! It will be a lot of fun!!! Admission is $5 or 3 pounds of food. All proceeds will benefit our District Project: The NJ Federation of Food Banks!

As always, do not hesitate to contact me or your LTG with any questions, especially about DCON. I want to see as many of you there!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
Josie Suddeth<br>
New Jersey District Governor<br>
