Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!

I hope you are all having fantastic summers that are filled with service! Several important events have just happened so you can find recaps below!

ICON 2015 was so much fun! All attendees learned a lot, strengthened their leadership skills, bonded with Key Clubbers and Kiwanis Family members from our district and the world, and more! Highlights included the Kiwanis Family Baseball Game, Key Club Opening Session, Kiwanis Opening and Closing Sessions, Cedar Point Amusement Park, and the Indianapolis Zoo! It was so cool to be with Kiwanis Family members as we celebrated Kiwanis’ 100th Birthday! Two amendments to our bylaws were passed during House of Delegates. These amendments need to be approved by Kiwanis International first so I will be sure to blog about the updates as soon as they are official. NJ K-Family members also had successful International Board Elections. Lance Incitti will be a three year Kiwanis International Trustee starting October 1st and Devin Sun will be a Key Club International Trustee until July 2016. Devin will be serving the Pacific Northwest, Carolinas, and Missouri-Arkansas Districts of Key Club International. I strongly recommend attending ICON 2016 in Atlanta! We already have exciting excursions planned and it is sure to be an exciting convention!

Our International Trustee for the 2015-2016 Service Year was assigned to us recently. Kacie Hines of the Alabama District will be our trustee! I am super excited about this! Kacie and I have some goals in place that will have a positive impact on all members in our district. Her introduction letter will be on her blog on the district website which she will update periodically throughout the year soon. Kacie has a rich history in the Kiwanis Family. Kacie’s mom is a member of the Kiwanis Committee of the Alabama District of Key Club International so she has been attending K-Family events since she was little. Before becoming a trustee, Kacie was the Alabama District Webmaster for the 2012-2013 service year, Alabama District Media Tech and Technology Committee Chair for the 2013-2014 service year, and a Distinguished District Governor for the 2014-2015 service year! Some fun facts about Kacie are that she just learned how to ride a bike last week and she owns every Audrey Hepburn movie that she ever starred in! Please reach out to her if you have any questions regarding the international level of Key Club.

About two weeks ago I was in Indianapolis with the rest of the International Council (the International Board and all the District Governors) for Leadership Conference! There we were able to discuss goals with our trustees, learn more leadership techniques, and grow as people! I had a lot of fun seeing the International Council again and setting goals with Kacie.

Many LTGs have been holding DCMs and trainings throughout the summer. Make sure you stay in the loop of what your LTG is doing so you definitely be ready for when school comes around. 

Please be sure to contact me or your LTG with any questions and I look forward to seeing you at upcoming district events!

Yours in Caring and Service,
Josie Suddeth
2015-2016 District Governor
