Hello New Jersey District!

I cannot believe we are already halfway through the service year! It is crazy to think that it’s already been six months since I set out my goals as governor.

When I ran I set out to do the following:

- Maintain communication with members of all branches of the K-Family.
- Run a monthly blog on the district website to help bridge the gap between club and district.
- Help clubs grow through aiding lieutenant governors.
- Improve district events with new information and fun elements to increase district participation.
- Oversee a large scale project for our new District Project.
- Make the New Jersey District the best of all the rest!

I am very happy to say that since I created these goals, they are all in progress and are looking good! I have tried to attend as many K-Family events as I can, especially since that is part of my Governor’s Project. I have attended Circle-K and Kiwanis events, board meetings and conventions. I have also remained in contact with each organization’s respective governor. I have and plan on posting on my blog monthly. I have remained in constant contact with all LTGs. I made them create newsletter and DCM schedules to ensure that they were getting out information at good intervals. I also give them individualized feedback every month, answer all their questions and help them whenever and however I can. This has helped them become better LTGs and helped many clubs grow. RTCs and Fall Rally plans are proof of my fourth goal, but it nowhere near being accomplished. This year at RTCs, we brought in an outside speaker, started new workshops and overall improved their functionality. There are lots of plans for Fall Rally to make it exciting but be prepared to be blown away! I plan to refresh DCON this year as well. For my second to last goal, we are currently in the planning stages of our Spike Out Hunger volleyball tournaments! These will be a bi-divisional volleyball tournaments and anyone in your school can participate! The winner from each tournament will move on to the district tournament! All proceeds and donations will go to our district project. One will be held at a school near you sometime in late October or November! We are definitely on our way for goal number 6! Your dedication to Key Club makes our district so spectacular!
Some upcoming things before I sign off:
Fall Rally: If you don’t want to go, do you even Key Club? Fall Rally is the largest gathering of Key Clubbers where the district board hosts a session to update you all with Key Club happenings then you have the rest of the day to adventure in the park! Admission also includes Fright Fest! The early registration deadline passed, but it only costs $42 to attend! Your club may collect this registration ahead of time, but if not you just bring your money the day of. Please contact me or your LTG with any questions!

RTCs: RTCs were extremely successful and all attendees certainly “Pumped Up the Volume of Service”! All attendees learned a lot and will be able to help grow their clubs! Missed this year’s RTCs? Don’t worry! There will be 2 RTCs in spring 2016 and 3 in the fall of 2016. 

District Project Updates: Please look out for news about your division’s Spike Out Hunger volleyball tournaments! It will be sometime in your area in November. Start planning your team now! Also, Hunger Awareness Week information will be sent to your club very soon! Be on the lookout for this and get ready to spread awareness about the extent of hunger in NJ. Finally, we are running a fundraiser for the district project! Your LTG has orange pens that say “Hunger Isn’t Write”. Be indePENdent of your teacher’s writing utensils and buy a pen for $1! All proceeds will benefit our district project.

Something to keep in mind is tomorrow (October 1st) is the official start of the 2015-2016 service year for Kiwanis. Be sure to talk to your Kiwanis club’s new officers!

Please contact me with any questions and I look forward to seeing you at Fall Rally!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
Josie Suddeth<br>
New Jersey District Governor
