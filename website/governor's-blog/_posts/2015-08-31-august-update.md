Hello NJ Key Clubbers!

I hope you all have had awesome summers! School is right around the corner and that means Key Club is in the full swing of things again! Yay! In this blog post, you will find what has been happening in NJ Key Club and some important updates as we head back to school!

Back to School is an exciting time in the Key Club year! You have the opportunity to recruit lots of new members, have new projects, attend exciting district events and more! While recruiting members, inspire potential members with the same enthusiasm that keeps you involved! Do things that will bring students to your meetings like food, a cool mini service project and then impress them with what Key Club is all about to keep them coming! 

The Back to School Mailing was released in mid-August. A virtual copy was sent to all officers by August 29th and every school was mailed a physical copy which your school should receive soon. This mailing has lots of important information for upcoming events. Some really important files include Fall Rally Registration and RTC info. Please be sure to read through it thoroughly!

Key Club Welcome Guide was sent to all club officers this month. This has a lot of useful info regarding district happenings and resources you can use for recruiting. I highly encourage you all to utilize this resource!

At our August Board Meeting, we decided what our district event for our district project will be! This year, we will be hosting Spike Out Hunger Volleyball Tournaments to benefit the NJ Federation of Food Banks. Bi-division volleyball tournaments will be held and the winner of each tournament will move onto the district tournament! Have fun while helping our district project! Your LTG will be holding this tournament before the end of November. More details will be available via your LTG. Please contact him or her with any questions!

The NJ District is welcoming a new board member. Farwa Shakeel will be the District Secretary for the duration of the 2015-2016 service year. Farwa is a rising senior at Piscataway High School in division 11. She is the IP LTG of Division 11, a Robert F. Lucas Outstanding Lieutenant Governor’s Award recipient, past DPS Co-Chair, past Scholarships Committee chair, past Distinguished Club President of Piscataway High School and more! 
Regional Training Conferences are right around the corner!  Regional Training Conferences, also called RTC’s, are hosted each year to train general members, officers and advisors alike to become more effective leaders and servers of their home, school, and community. Through four individual sessions that include several workshops to choose from, Key Clubbers learn important aspects of their roles in the club. RTC’s hold informative workshops on district events, service and fundraising ideas, public speaking, and ways to get more involved with Key Club. All NJ Key Clubbers are encouraged to attend. Each officer must attend at least one Regional Training Conference in order to be recognized as a distinguished officer at District Convention. There will be an RTC on September 12th at West Deptford High School, September 13th at Phillipsburg High School, and September 19th at Millburn High School. 

Fall Rally is the largest gathering of NJ Key Clubbers at Six Flags Great Adventure to kick off a new school year of service! This year’s theme is “Oh the Service You’ll Do!”! Admission includes a fun and informative session, early admission to the park, and fright fest! Learn more about what is going on in Key Club while having fun! How much does it cost to get into this awesome event? Season pass holders can get in for $7 regardless of when you sign up. If your club does early registration, the cost is $37 per member. Late registration is $41 per member. It is sure to be a very fun day! Please contact your LTG with any questions!

Please contact me or your LTG with any questions!

Yours in Caring and Service,

<br>New Jersey District Governor
