Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!

My name is Josie Suddeth and I am extremely honored and excited to serve as your District Governor for the 2015-2016 Service Year. 

As promised in my campaign, I will be posting a monthly blog on the New Jersey District Website. I hope to further bridge the gap between club and district, and let you know what the district is up to through this.

Since I will be your District Governor this year, I want to give you a little brief overview of who I am. The way to success is when the leader works as his or her followers. I want to be as relatable and approachable as possible. If you want to learn even more about me and my goals for this year, go to the board tab on the website, click on me, and read my Letter of Introduction.

Name: Josie Suddeth

Past Key Club Positions: Lieutenant Governor of Division 7, Vice President, Historian

Favorite Colors: Light blue, pink, lime green, and lavender

Theme Song: Walking on Sunshine

Favorite Book: The Hunger Games Series by Suzanne Collins

Favorite Movie: The Parent Trap

Favorite Song: I Lived by One Republic

Favorite Food: Apple Crisp

Favorite Quote: “It doesn’t matter where you go, but what you do when you are there.”

Favorite Key Club Service Project: My club held a joint project with Pennsylvania K-Family members my freshman year to help with Hurricane Sandy Relief. We had a 2 mile beach clean-up, gave cupcakes to emergency responders, and ran a lunch for those still displaced by the storm. 

Funniest Key Club Moment: At Midwinter 2014, my room’s alarm clock didn’t go off and we had to rush to get to the session on time. I whipped out running while on the way to the elevator.

Favorite Key Club Event: I can’t pick just one! They are all so fun, informative and unique in their own respective ways.

It was amazing seeing a lot of you at DCON 2015! I hope you enjoyed the experience as much as I did. DCON 2016 will be even more exciting; I hope to see all underclassmen there next year!
The most important thing the District Board is working on right now is Regional Training Conferences.  Regional Training Conferences are events run by our district where attendees have the opportunity to attend a general session, attend fascinating workshops, eat 2 great meals, and get the chance to win Key Club prizes! These workshops range from specific officer positions to Fundraising Ideas, to How to Get More Involved in Your Division! They are especially helpful for new officers to learn more about their jobs, but general members get just as much if not more out of the experience. Regional Training Conferences are quickly approaching! While the exact locations are not yet solidified, one will definitely be held in southern New Jersey and the other in northern New Jersey. The dates for the two Spring RTCs are May 9th and May 16th and they will both be from 9am-1pm.

Another exciting event happening in the Key Club world is International Convention. This year International Convention is in Indianapolis, Indiana (the best city in the country to hold a convention). International Convention is kind of like DCON but 100 times better and bigger. Attendees attend general sessions, attend caucus sessions, elect the International Board, attend workshops, explore the host city, mingle with Key Clubbers from all over the world, and so much more. On top of the educational part of ICON, attendees will attend a block party, attend a minor league baseball game, attend the largest pancake breakfast ever, and attend a private Hello, Goodbye concert and more! This year is particularly exciting because it is the 100th anniversary of Kiwanis International. Kiwanis, Circle K, and Key Club are holding one joint International Convention. ICON is the must go to event of the Key Club year! For New Jersey Key Clubbers, ICON will begin on June 23rd and end June 30th. On top of the exciting ICON schedule, our district will travel to Hershey Park in Hershey, Pennsylvania; Columbus, Ohio; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio; and Cedar Point Amusement Park in Sandusky, Ohio! I will be attending and I hope to see you there as well. The first payment is due by May 8th to District Administrator Ms. McCann. If you would like the registration packet, please contact your Lieutenant Governor. 

Some exciting things I specifically have and will be doing are the following. I have been busily and happily working with all aspects of the District to make sure we start off on the right foot! These range from talking to board members, planning committee work, and planning RTCs! I will be attending the Governor’s and Administrator’s Training Conference in Atlanta, Georgia in about 2 weeks where I will learn how to better serve you. The District Board has its first official board meeting this weekend. Be on the lookout for updates from this meeting!
Thank you for reading this blog post and I look forward to seeing you at upcoming district events!

Yours in Caring and Service,

Josie Suddeth

2015-2016 New Jersey District Governor
