Hello New Jersey District!

I hope you all are enjoying your holiday breaks!

The December Mailing was sent to all clubs this month. Please make sure you **thoroughly** go through it with your other officers and advisor. There are a lot of important documents in it.

LTG Elections are rapidly approaching! LTGs are district liaisons to clubs in the same division. They have a neat job because they get to work hands-on with people on the club and district levels. It is a great opportunity to know service oriented people like you and truly make a difference in New Jersey. All LTG Elections are being held sometime between mid-January and mid-February, depending on what division you are from. If you have any interest in becoming an LTG, contact your division’s LTG or Elections Chair Zierra Dean.

DCON is rapidly approaching! DCON is April 1st-3rd at the Ocean Place Resort and Spa in Long Branch, NJ. DCON is my **favorite** Key Club event!!!! At DCON, you get to connect with other service oriented teens from across the state, listen to inspiring speakers, attend intriguing workshops, elect the district executives, spend time near the beach and more! This year’s theme will also make it a very fun convention. Also, John Shertzer is the Keynote Speaker this year which is extremely exciting!!! Mr. Shertzer is the Chief Programs Officer at Kiwanis International and gave an amazing presentation at ICON 2015. All of these exciting aspects are sure to make DCON 2016 one for the history books. The DCON Registration Packet was in the December Mailing. Start planning now!

It was so great to meet so many amazing Key Clubbers at Key Leader earlier this month. I learned a lot and had so much fun as a student facilitator. Shout out to The Kind Kewl-olas!!!! If you aren’t graduating this year like me (tears), I strongly urge you to attend.

Spike Out Hunger tournaments have been widely successful at divisional tournaments across the state. Thank you so much to everyone who has supported the cause. Some divisions still have to have their tournaments so please be sure to organize a team and support hunger in NJ if this applies to you. The district tournament for divisional winners will be in mid-February at a Central NJ school. Everyone in the district is welcome to attend the district tournament. It is going to be a lot of fun to see these teams battle it out. I highly recommend attending this tournament if you are available.

The January Board Meeting is the weekend of January 9th and 10th. A lot of DCON planning is going to be happening there so be sure to be on the lookout for updates after the meeting.

Are you ready to share your Key Club Problems? Look at the NJ Key Club Twitter? Look at the NJ Key Club Twitter account after January 1st to learn more.

Please be sure to contact me with any questions and have a splendiferous day!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
Josie Suddeth<br>
New Jersey District Governor<br>
