Hello New Jersey District!

I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving! 

The District just sent out three surveys, 2 from NJ and one from International: an officer feedback survey to give feedback for LTGs, the District Feedback and Improvements survey, and an officer survey from international. These surveys will help us operate better, but do not feel pressured to fill it out if you don’t have feedback.

Spike Out Hunger tournaments have been widely successful at divisional tournaments across the state. Thank you so much to everyone who has supported the cause. Some divisions still have to have their tournaments so please be sure to organize a team and support hunger in NJ if this applies to your division. The district tournament for divisional winners will be in mid-February so please be sure to be on the lookout for specifics about it.

DCON will be from April 1st-3rd at the Ocean Place Resort and Spa in Long Branch, NJ. The theme is titled “License to Serve” and has a James Bond and Mission Impossible feel. We have a lot of exciting workshops, speakers, and activities planned so be sure to stay on the lookout for DCON updates.  I highly recommend attending!

The December Mailing will be sent out to all clubs soon. There are a lot of important district updates in it so please be sure to go through it thoroughly. Some highlights include the DCON Registration Packet, Elections Packet, Contests Packet, Scholarships Packet and more. It will be sent electronically and physically.

As we pass the halfway mark of the service year, we have to begin thinking about next year. Lieutenant Governor Elections will be hosted by your current LTG between mid-January and mid-February. If you have any interest in running, do not hesitate to contact your LTG. Executive Board Elections will occur at DCON and the webmaster will be appointed at DCON. Interested candidates must send a paper to Elections Chair by mid-February. Editor, Treasurer, Secretary, and Governor candidates will caucus, and give Zierra speeches at the convention and will be elected at the House of Delegates. Candidates cannot declare their candidacy or campaign prior to the Friday of DCON or else they endanger their candidacy. Webmaster candidates will fill out the application and interview with me. All details will be in the elections packet. If you have any questions regarding the elections process, please do not hesitate to contact me, your LTG, or Elections Chair Zierra.

Key Leader is happening next weekend! Key Leader is a team building, leadership strengthening weekend in Port Murray, NJ. Registration is now closed, but be sure to sign up next year if you have an interest in attending. Be sure to keep up with the NJ District throughout the weekend!

Please don’t hesitate to contact me with questions and have a great day!

Yours in Caring and Service,<br>
Josie Suddeth<br>
New Jersey District Governor<br>
