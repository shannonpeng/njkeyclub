Hello New Jersey Key Clubbers!
I hope you all had an amazing month! I hope the stress of APs, Proms, and upcoming finals are soothed by recent and upcoming Key Club events!

The 2015-2016 New Jersey District Board and I met for our first official board meeting the weekend of April 18th. This meeting was extremely productive; we have lots of ideas and plans that will ensure a successful service year. As many of you know, the District Project for this year is The NJ Federation of Food Banks. We discussed a lot of ideas to involve you all and potential district wide events like last year’s Eliminathons. We encourage you all to fundraise, do service, and do food drives for your local food banks. Keep an eye out for new updates.

We also decided that the advocacy focus will be Autism. We encourage you all to get involved with local events that help autism and with your school’s programs. Throughout the year, your LTG will inform you of events that the district is promoting and encouraging you to attend. On May 31st in Paramus NJ, Go the Distance for Autism will be happening. Run by Beth Callahan, who we will be working with this year, this event has multiple bike rides with different lengths and all the money will go to several different autism programs. Visit [here] (https://secure3.convio.net/gtd/site/SPageServer/;jsessionid=A9AA3161CE19360F7F8FCDC33BAEA77D.app328a) to learn more or contact your lieutenant governor.

Regional Training Conferences are events run by our district where attendees have the opportunity to attend a general session, attend fascinating workshops, eat 2 great meals, and get the chance to win Key Club prizes! These workshops range from specific officer positions to Fundraising Ideas, to How to Get More Involved in Your Division! They are especially helpful for new officers to learn more about their jobs, but general members get just as much if not more out of the experience. The first RTC was on May 9th at Morris County School of Technology! There was a great turn out and all attendees learned a lot! The next RTC will be on May 16th at Southern Regional High School from 9am-1pm. It is sure to be a great event. Remember, in order to be a distinguished officer, you must attend at least one RTC.

I am also pleased to announce that my Governor’s Project this year will be K-Family Relations and K-Family Building. I think this is especially important since we are in Kiwanis’ 100th year and Key Club’s 90th year. The bond between K-Family bonds is so important. When you support each other, each club grows and changes more lives for the better. Also, by giving community members the opportunity to be involved with the K-Family, you give someone the opportunity to change the world. You would be part of the reason a club does all the good it does. How cool is that?  I will be doing more throughout the year to promote this. I encourage you all to get more involved with your nearby K-Family clubs and build new clubs!

From April 30th-May 3rd, I attended the Governors and Administrators Training Conference (GATC) in Atlanta, Georgia. I was able to learn how to be a better governor, get international updates, meet all the other governors, have fun exploring Atlanta and more! We even stayed at the hotel where parts of The Hunger Games were filmed and where ICON 2016 will be! It was an unforgettable experience!

Thank you so much for reading this! I can’t wait to see you all at upcoming district events!
 
Yours in Caring and Service,

Josie Suddeth

2015-2016 New Jersey District Governor
