On the sub-committee Service, the committee works to keep track of the service conducted with the New Jersey Federation of Food Banks. It brainstorms possible service project ideas and determines the path that will most influence the district's homes, schools, and communities. The committee also may coordinate Key Club Service days at the Food Banks but, mostly serve to ensure the district meets the service hour goal of 18,630 hours. 18 for the 1 in 8 people in New Jersey who struggle with hunger. 630 for the 630,000 children living in impoverished house holds.
