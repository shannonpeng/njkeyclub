The Outside Organizations/Youth Opportunities Fund is a subcommittee in the standing committee International Programs. The Youth Opportunities Fund (YOF) is an endowed fund for Key Club International that provides funds to help Key Clubs execute their service opportunities. YOF grants can help your club perform the service project of your dreams; start looking around your school, community, or world for things that need improvement! Applications are due on October 15th at 11:59 EST each year â€“ do not miss the deadline, there is only one funding cycle per year! Clubs may request financial assistance for said service project ranging anywhere from $100-$2000. The YOF committee usually allots the funds to clubs who ask for a portion of the total cost of the project, and to projects that are working with other organizations to fund and complete the project. The current application for the YOF grants can be found on the [Key Club International site](www.keyclub.org). 

The other main focus of this subcommittee is Outside Organizations. Our main goal is to shed light on some of the wonderful organizations in the world that Key Clubbers can get involved with, yet it is not an organization specifically endorsed by the New Jersey District. By showcasing outside organizations, we are trying to spread the love for service on a greater scale and increase awareness for certain organizations. If you have any suggestions for outside organizations that should be encouraged to the New Jersey District, or have any questions regarding the Youth Opportunities Fund, feel free to contact Lieutenant Governor of Division 1 [Thomas Beeby](/board/tom.html).
