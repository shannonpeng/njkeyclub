The Public Relations Committee dedicates itself to promoting the ideals of Key Club. Through the use of flyers, videos, social media profiles on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and more, the committee serves to better connect the members of the New Jersey District of Key Club International as well as consistently provide the most recent, relevant information possible.

The committee consists of two subcommittees: Publicize and Inform. The Publicize subcommittee includes [District Editor David Guirgis](/board/david.html), [District Webmaster Shannon Peng](/board/shannon.html), and [District Secretary Sarah Park](/board/sarahp.html). The Inform subcommittee includes [Division 20 Lieutenant Governor Priya Lad](/board/priya.html), [Division 15 Lieutenant Governor Mark Ozdemir](/board/mark.html), and [Division 4 Lieutenant Governor Juan Carlos Belmonte](/board/juan.html).

As of May 2015, the Public Relations Committee has designed Facebook covers as well as filmed, edited, and published the promotional video for fall and spring Regional Training Conferences. It has designed a flyer listing the social media accounts of the district. The Public Relations Committee is currently working on developing brochures detailing information such as meeting ideas, dues, the District Project and advocacy focus, the Brand Guide, how to build a website and the resources that are available on the district site.

Some ideas the Committee has in store for the future include a social media shoutout to a Member of the Week, implementing Snapchat geofilters and live events, and possibly using Periscope for large-scale events such as Fall Rally. The theme for Fall Rally will be “All the Service You Can Do”, inspired by Dr. Seuss, and the Public Relations Committee will begin an immersive campaign to promote the event beginning mid-summer.
