On the Students Change Hunger / Public Relations subcommittee, we have been discussing ideas for clubs during the Students Change Hunger Challenge. The challenge will run from mid-September through mid-November. Public Relations will be creating advertising materials to spread word about the challenge when the time comes, and be the go-to people for any questions regarding the challenge. Although September seems far away, it's closer than you think, so be sure to keep a look out for the Students Change Hunger Challenge in your school!
