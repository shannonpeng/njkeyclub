<b>March for Babies</b> is a collection of annual walks throughout the spring sponsored by March of Dimes to provide for prematurity research and help to premature babies in newborn intensive care. Walking since 1970, March of Dimes has raised an incredible $2.3 billion to benefit all babies. To participate in the walk you can either fundraise and walk or volunteer at the event. For more information on your local walk or about how to get involved contact your Lieutenant Governor.
