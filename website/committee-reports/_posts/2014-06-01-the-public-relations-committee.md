The Public Relations Committee is dedicated to promoting the ideals of Key Club and its works through the creation and use of various sources of media to fit public needs. Through the usage of such forms of social media as Facebook and Twitter, as well as the distribution of flyers and creation of videos, we hope to present the New Jersey District of Key Club International in a fun, hands-on manner that both serves to relay relevant information as well as interact with each member on a social media based level.

There are three subcommittees in Public Relations: Publicize, Inform, and Promotion, with the co-chairs, District Editor Patrick Quinn and Lieutenant Governor of Division 16 David Guirgis, taking active roles in all committees.

The *Publicize* subcommittee, [Lieutenant Governor Darren Khong](/board/darren.html) and [District Webmaster Srikar Gudipati](/board/srikar.html), made presentations regarding the benefits of attending Regional Training Conferences and Fall Rally. The media, local newspapers within each RTC host town, was contacted, and various discussions were made about how to continue publicizing District events, with suggestions ranging from social media countdowns to Vines.

The *Inform* committee, [Lieutenant Governor Jae Shin](/board/jae.html) and [Lieutenant Governor Harsh Patel](/board/harsh.html), is working on creating informational brochures and presentations for recently chartered Key Clubs and target schools.

The *Promotion* subcommittee, [Lieutenant Governor Jae Shin](/board/jae.html) and [Lieutenant Governor Darren Khong](/board/darren.html), is creating plans for promotional commercials and videos for New Jersey Key Club events specifically Fall Rally.

While each subcommittee seems separate from the other, excellent communication with the rest of the NJ District has allowed for greater integration and involvement within each other’s committees, as well as a greater sense of planning when deciding what needs to be done. After all, even with each subcommittee, we are still Public Relations: dedicated to serving, informing and entertaining all of you avid and dedicated Key Clubbers.

Expect to hear more from us soon. We can’t wait to show you what we have planned!
